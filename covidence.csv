"The association of polygenic risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression with neural connectivity in adolescents and young adults: examining developmental and sex differences.","Meyers, J L; Chorlian, D B; Bigdeli, T B; Johnson, E C; Aliev, F; Agrawal, A; Almasy, L; Anokhin, A; Edenberg, H J; Foroud, T; Goate, A; Kamarajan, C; Kinreich, S; Nurnberger, J; Pandey, A K; Pandey, G; Plawecki, M H; Salvatore, J E; Zhang, J; Fanous, A; Porjesz, B","Neurodevelopmental abnormalities in neural connectivity have been long implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ); however, it remains unclear whether these neural connectivity patterns are associated with genetic risk for SCZ in unaffected individuals (i.e., an absence of clinical features of SCZ or a family history of SCZ). We examine whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for SCZ are associated with functional neural connectivity in adolescents and young adults without SCZ, whether this association is moderated by sex and age, and if similar associations are observed for genetically related neuropsychiatric PRS. One-thousand four-hundred twenty-six offspring from 913 families, unaffected with SCZ, were drawn from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) prospective cohort (median age at first interview = 15.6 (12-26), 51.6% female, 98.1% European American, 41% with a family history of alcohol dependence). Participants were followed longitudinally with resting-state EEG connectivity (i.e., coherence) assessed every two years. Higher SCZ PRS were associated with elevated theta (3-7 Hz) and alpha (7-12 Hz) EEG coherence. Associations differed by sex and age; the most robust associations were observed between PRS and parietal-occipital, central-parietal, and frontal-parietal alpha coherence among males between ages 15-19 (B: 0.15-0.21, p &amp;lt; 10 <sup>-4</sup> ). Significant associations among EEG coherence and Bipolar and Depression PRS were observed, but differed from SCZ PRS in terms of sex, age, and topography. Findings reveal that polygenic risk for SCZ is robustly associated with increased functional neural connectivity among young adults without a SCZ diagnosis. Striking differences were observed between men and women throughout development, mapping onto key periods of risk for the onset of psychotic illness and underlining the critical importance of examining sex differences in associations with neuropsychiatric PRS across development.",,,Translational psychiatry,11,1,54,33446638,10.1038/s41398-020-01185-7,33446638,#293,,"Onyx Scheuer (2025-09-03 07:33:24)(Select): no psychopathology outcome (my note below is incorrect); Onyx Scheuer (2025-08-30 11:23:55)(Screen): Could be looking at relevant PRS (if similar associations are observed for genetically related neuropsychiatric PRS.), did look at SCZ diagnoses; Emily Meng (2025-08-30 10:25:00)(Screen): prs for schizophrenia and outcome is neural connectivity; ",For Mahnoor's review?

Genetic risk of AUDs and childhood impulsivity: Examining the role of parenting and family environment.,"Su, Jinni; Trevino, Angel; Jamil, Belal; Aliev, Fazil","This study examined the independent and interactive effects of genetic risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD), parenting behaviors, and family environment on childhood impulsivity.

Participants completed questionnaires and provided saliva or blood samples for genotyping. Results indicated no significant main effects of AUD genome-wide polygenic scores (AUD-PRS) on childhood impulsivity as measured by the UPPS-P scale across racial/ethnic groups. In general, parental monitoring and parental acceptance were associated with lower impulsivity; family conflict was associated with higher impulsivity. There was an interaction effect between AUD-PRS and family conflict, such that family conflict exacerbated the association between AUD-PRS and positive urgency, only among Black/African American youth. This was the only significant interaction effect detected from a total of 45 tests (five impulsivity dimensions, three subsamples, and three family factors), and thus may be a false positive and needs to be replicated.

Associated and intermediate factors between genetic variants of the dopaminergic D2 receptor gene and harmful alcohol use in young adults.,"Mattioni, Julia; Vansteene, Clément; Poupon, Daphnee; Gorwood, Philip; Ramoz, Nicolas","Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and ankyrin repeat and kinase domain-containing protein 1 (ANKK1) genes have received considerable attention for their involvement in alcohol use disorder (AUD), but many questions remain on their exact role. We conducted a population-based case-control and genetic association study in a large sample of young adults. Our aim was to assess the association between DRD2 and ANKK1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and harmful alcohol use, disentangling associated and possible intermediate factors. A total of 1841 college students from the French region Champagne-Ardennes, aged between 18 and 21 years and who reported at least one lifetime alcohol consumption, were included in this study. Allele frequencies were analysed according to harmful alcohol use (assessed through the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT] questionnaire). Different substance use disorders, including nicotine and cannabis dependences, were also assessed through questionnaires, as was a list of potential associated factors (e.g., major depressive episode, conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], school failure, sugar consumption, sexual trauma, parents' use of alcohol, tobacco or cannabis). We found that DRD2 rs1800498 was associated with harmful alcohol use. Many factors were detected, but a global path analysis revealed that DRD2 rs1800498 had a significant direct effect on harmful alcohol use and that early age at first alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms moderated this effect. This study suggests an interplay between harmful alcohol use, DRD2 genotypes and other risk factors that, with a full understanding, could be useful for preventive purposes.",2023,Mar,Addiction biology,28,3,e13269,36825486,10.1111/adb.13269,36825486,#320,Mattioni 2023,"",""

Despite associations among OPRM1 (rs179971) and DRD2 (rs6277) genes and structural alterations in neural reward pathways implicated in SUDs, little is known about the contribution of risk-related gene variants to structural neurodevelopment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of initially SU-naïve adolescents (N = 129; 70 females; 11-14 years old), participants underwent an MRI structural scan at baseline and provided genetic assays for OPRM1 and DRD2 with SU behavior assessed during follow-up visits. Baseline differences in key reward-related brain regions (i.e., bilateral caudate and cingulate cortex) were detected in those with genetic liability for SU in OPRM1 who went onto engage in SU at subsequent waves of data collection. In addition, main effects of OPRM1, DRD2, and SU were related to variability in structure of the putamen, anterior cingulate, and nucleus accumbens, respectively.

The anticholinergic agent scopolamine has also shown promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. This study applied genome-wide markers to investigate the role of genetic variants in predicting acute antidepressant response to both agents. The ketamine-treated sample included 157 unrelated European subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The scopolamine-treated sample comprised 37 unrelated European subjects diagnosed with either MDD or BD who had a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE), and had failed at least two adequate treatment trials for depression. Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scale scores at day 1 (24 h post-treatment) was considered the primary outcome. Here, we conduct pilot genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses to identify potential markers of ketamine response and dissociative side effects. Polygenic risk score analysis of SNPs ranked by the strength of their association with ketamine response was then calculated in order to assess whether common genetic markers from the ketamine study could predict response to scopolamine.

Polygenic risk scores for alcohol involvement relate to brain structure in substance-naïve children: Results from the ABCD study.,"Hatoum, Alexander S; Johnson, Emma C; Baranger, David A A; Paul, Sarah E; Agrawal, Arpana; Bogdan, Ryan","Brain imaging-derived structural correlates of alcohol involvement have largely been speculated to arise as a consequence of alcohol exposure. However, they may also reflect predispositional risk. In substance naïve children of European ancestry who completed the baseline session of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n = 3013), mixed-effects models estimated whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for problematic alcohol use (PAU-PRS) and drinks per week (DPW-PRS) are associated with magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain structure phenotypes (i.e., total and regional: cortical thickness, surface area and volume; subcortical volume; white matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity). Follow-up analyses evaluated whether any identified regions were also associated with polygenic risk among substance naïve children of African ancestry (n = 898). After adjustment for multiple testing correction, polygenic risk for PAU was associated with lower volume of the left frontal pole and greater cortical thickness of the right supramarginal gyrus (|βs| &amp;gt; 0.009; ps &amp;lt; 0.001; ps <sub>fdr</sub> &amp;lt; 0.046; r <sup>2</sup> s &amp;lt; 0.004). PAU PRS and DPW PRS showed nominally significant associations with a host of other regional brain structure phenotypes (e.g., insula surface area and volume). None of these regions showed any, even nominal association among children of African ancestry. Genomic liability to alcohol involvement may manifest as variability in brain structure during middle childhood prior to alcohol use initiation. Broadly, alcohol-related variability in brain morphometry may partially reflect predisposing genomic influence. Larger discovery genome-wide association studies and target samples of diverse ancestries are needed to determine whether observed associations may generalize across ancestral origins.",,,"Genes, brain, and behavior",,,e12756,34092032,10.1111/gbb.12756,34092032,#403,,"",""

The genetic etiology of psychosis symptoms in youth remains poorly understood. To characterize genetic risk for psychosis spectrum symptoms (PS), we leverage a community-based multiethnic sample of children and adolescents aged 8-22 years, the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n = 7225, 20% PS). Using an elastic net regression model, we aim to classify PS status using polygenic scores (PGS) based on a range of heritable psychiatric and brain-related traits in a multi-PGS model. We also perform univariate PGS associations and evaluate age-specific effects. The multi-PGS analyses do not improve prediction of PS status over univariate models, but reveal that the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) PGS is robustly and uniquely associated with PS (OR 1.12 (1.05, 1.18) P = 0.0003).

We find a significant interaction of ADHD PGS with age (P = 0.01), with a stronger association in younger children. The association is independent of phenotypic overlap between ADHD and PS, not indirectly driven by substance use or childhood trauma, and appears to be specific to PS rather than reflecting general psychopathology in youth.

Adolescent cannabis use and adult psychoticism: A longitudinal co-twin control analysis using data from two cohorts.,"Schaefer, Jonathan D; Jang, Seon-Kyeong; Vrieze, Scott; Iacono, William G; McGue, Matt; Wilson, Sylia","Observational studies have repeatedly linked cannabis use and increased risk of psychosis. We sought to clarify whether this association reflects a causal effect of cannabis exposure or residual confounding. We analyzed data from two cohorts of twins who completed repeated, prospective measures of cannabis use ( <i>N</i> = 1544) and cannabis use disorder symptoms ( <i>N</i> = 1458) in adolescence and a dimensional measure of psychosis-proneness (the Personality Inventory for <i>DSM</i> -5 Psychoticism scale) in adulthood. Twins also provided molecular genetic data, which were used to estimate polygenic risk of schizophrenia. Both cumulative adolescent cannabis use and use disorder were associated with higher Psychoticism scores in adulthood. However, we found no evidence of an effect of cannabis on Psychoticism or any of its facets in co-twin control models that compared the greater-cannabis-using twin to the lesser-using co-twin. We also observed no evidence of a differential effect of cannabis on Psychoticism by polygenic risk of schizophrenia. Although cannabis use and disorder are consistently associated with increased risk of psychosis, the present results suggest this association is likely attributable to familial confounds rather than a causal effect of cannabis exposure.

Association Between Parental Anxiety and Depression Level and Psychopathological Symptoms in Offspring With 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.,"Sandini, Corrado; Schneider, Maude; Eliez, Stephan; Armando, Marco","22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is recognized as one of the strongest genetic risk factors for the development of psychopathology, including dramatically increased prevalence of schizophrenia anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite sharing a homogenous genetic deletion, the psychiatric phenotype in 22q11DS still present significant variability across subjects. The origins of such variability remain largely unclear. Levels of parental psychopathology could significantly contribute to phenotypic variability of offspring psychopathology, through mechanisms of gene x gene (GxG) and gene x environment (GxE) interactions. However, this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested to date in 22q11DS. In the present manuscript, we employed a longitudinal design to investigate bi-directional interactions of parental anxiety and depressive symptoms, estimated with Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory, and offspring level of psychopathology assessed with a combination of parentally reported Child Behavioral Checklist, Youth Self Report Questionnaire, and Structured Clinical Interviews for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS). We tested associations in both typically developing healthy controls (HCs) (N = 88 participants; N = 131 time points) and in individuals with 22q11DS (N = 103 participants; N = 198 time points). We observed that 22q11DS individuals with higher levels of parental anxiety and depression presented significant increases in multiple forms of psychopathology, including higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as estimated both by parental and self-report questionnaires, along with higher negative and generalized symptoms as measured with the SIPS. Associations for positive and disorganized dimensions of the SIPS were not statistically significant. Purely longitudinal analysis pointed to bi-directional interactions of parental and child psychopathology, with marginally stronger longitudinal associations between early parental anxiety-depression and subsequent child psychopathology. Interestingly, associations between psychopathology across generations were significantly stronger in 22q11DS individuals compared to HCs. Our results show that parental levels of anxiety and depression are associated with levels of offspring psychopathology, particularly in individuals with 22q11DS. These findings point to the existence of GxG or GxE mechanisms, that should be investigated in future work. From a clinical perspective, they highlight a strong rational for the management of parental psychological well-being in 22q11DS.",,,Frontiers in psychiatry,11,,646,32792992,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00646,32792992,#423,,"",""

Editorial: Understanding the Child at Risk for Substance Use Disorders: Neuroimaging Addiction Risk.,"Hulvershorn, Leslie A","Recent surveys demonstrate skyrocketing rates of adolescent vaping, <sup>1</sup> while the opioid epidemic, rightfully, is daily front page news. At the same time, the public perceives cannabis as a harmless source of recreation or even as cure-all therapy. Now more than ever, child and adolescent psychiatrists, politicians, policy leaders, and parents need empirical support to bolster the position that drugs of abuse should be avoided by young people. We have a robust literature connecting cannabis use to earlier and worse psychotic disorders, <sup>2</sup> as well as strong longitudinal data implicating cannabis in various neuropsychological deficits. <sup>3</sup> What our field lacks, however, are brain imaging studies that definitively document the negative neurobiological impact of substance use on the developing human brain. The key to appreciating why this research literature is so limited has to do with one of the core tenets of substance use disorder (SUD) etiology: SUDs do not emerge de novo in adulthood or late adolescence when people typically present with impairing symptoms. Decades of research now suggests that certain latent childhood traits predispose some youth to initiate and then escalate drug and alcohol use more often than is typical. <sup>4</sup> Children born into families with SUDs are more likely to express these highly heritable traits and are additionally subject to environmental risk factors and adversity. Therefore, children born into families with SUDs are disproportionately laden with genetic and environmental factors that shape brain structure and function. In other words, before exposure to drugs of abuse (which themselves may influence the brain), some children's brains already differ from those of typically developing youth. This observation limits the usefulness of cross-sectional neuroimaging studies that compare youth who have used drugs to those who have not, because of the nonrandom interaction of latent traits, environmental factors, and pre-existing brain differences.

Adversity and Depression: The Moderating Role of Stress Reactivity among High and Low Risk Youth.,"Daches, Shimrit; Vine, Vera; George, Charles J; Kovacs, Maria","Adverse life events have been causally linked to depression among youth at high risk for depression. But given that not all high-risk youth develop depression following adversity, individual differences in various processes, including physiological reactivity to stress, are likely to be at play. This longitudinal prospective study tested the hypothesis that, among high-risk youth exposed to adversities, extent of physiological reactivity to laboratory stress (indexed as respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) would predict subsequent depressive symptoms. Subjects were youth at high (n = 80) and low (n = 74) familial risk for depression. At Time 1 (T1), RSA was assessed during a cognitive stress task. At Time 2 (T2) about 2 years later, parents reported on adversities experienced by their offspring during the interim. At T1 and T2, youth received a diagnostic evaluation, which included assessment of their depressive symptoms. The three-way interaction of group-X-adversities-X-RSA predicted T2 depressive symptoms (controlling for T1 depressive symptoms). This interaction was mostly driven by the moderating effect of RSA among high-risk youth, such that adversities predicted higher depressive symptoms for those who displayed greater RSA reactivity to stress. Among low-risk youth, an inverse marginal moderating effect of RSA was found, such that adversities tended to predict depressive symptoms for those who displayed blunted RSA reactivity to stress. Thus, high physiological stress reactivity appears to be an additional risk factor for depressive symptoms only among youth at elevated risk for such outcomes, and should be taken into consideration in efforts to prevent depression in these populations.",2019,Aug,Journal of abnormal child psychology,47,8,1391-1399,30828776,10.1007/s10802-019-00527-4,30828776,#479,Daches 2019,"",""

Our aim was to determine if the polygenic score (PGS) for ASD is associated with parent-reported executive dysfunction in everyday life using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Furthermore, we investigated if PGS for general intelligence (INT) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also correlate with BRIEF. We included 176 children, adolescents and young adults aged 5-22 years with full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) above 70. All were admitted for clinical assessment of ASD symptoms and 68% obtained an ASD diagnosis. We found a significant difference between low and high ASD PGS groups in the BRIEF behavior regulation index (BRI) (P = 0.015, Cohen's d = 0.69). A linear regression model accounting for age, sex, full-scale IQ, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total score, ASD, ADHD and INT PGS groups as well as genetic principal components, significantly predicted the BRI score; F(11,130) = 8.142, P &amp;lt; 0.001, R <sup>2</sup> = 0.41 (unadjusted).

In contrast to indicators of any early alcohol use, such as AFD, indicators of a pattern of repeated drinking may be more likely to be causally associated with later problematic alcohol use. The current study examined AFD and age of onset of regular drinking (ARD; defined as drinking at least once a month for 6 or more months) as quasicausal predictors of lifetime AUD symptoms. Participants were 3,005 adult Australian twins who reported having been regular drinkers in their lifetime. Semistructured interviews were conducted to assess AFD, ARD, AUD, externalizing symptomatology, and other substance use. Personality traits were assessed via questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted multilevel discordant twin models were conducted using data from 1,041 complete twin pairs; adjusted models included socioeconomic status, personality, conduct disorder, and early initiation of regular smoking and marijuana use as covariates. Results from fully adjusted models controlling for familial confounds provided evidence for a causal influence of ARD on AUD symptoms, whereby twins with an earlier age of regular drinking than their cotwin had more lifetime AUD symptoms. However, AFD did not significantly predict AUD symptoms after adjusting for confounds. These results suggest that early regular drinking may serve as a causal risk factor for future problems, while early initiation of any alcohol use may indicate genetic liability.

Moreover, it remains unclear whether genetic influences could contribute to these associations. Participants were 290 children from the Twins Early Development Study. ACEs were assessed from age 3-11 years. We calculated a cumulative risk score and also derived different ACEs clusters using factor analysis and latent class analysis. HPA-axis activity was indexed by daytime salivary cortisol at age 11. Depressive symptoms were ascertained at age 21. Genetic liability to altered cortisol levels and elevated depressive symptoms was measured using a twin-based method. We performed causal mediation analysis with mixed-effects regression models. The results showed that ACEs cumulative exposure (b = -0.20, p = 0.03), bullying (b = -0.61, p = 0.01), and emotional abuse (b = -0.84, p = 0.02) were associated with lower cortisol levels at age 11.

Genetic overlap and causal associations between smoking behaviours and mental health.,"Barkhuizen, Wikus; Dudbridge, Frank; Ronald, Angelica","Cigarette smoking is a modifiable behaviour associated with mental health. We investigated the degree of genetic overlap between smoking behaviours and psychiatric traits and disorders, and whether genetic associations exist beyond genetic influences shared with confounding variables (cannabis and alcohol use, risk-taking and insomnia). Second, we investigated the presence of causal associations between smoking initiation and psychiatric traits and disorders. We found significant genetic correlations between smoking and psychiatric disorders and adult psychotic experiences. When genetic influences on known covariates were controlled for, genetic associations between most smoking behaviours and schizophrenia and depression endured (but not with bipolar disorder or most psychotic experiences). Mendelian randomization results supported a causal role of smoking initiation on psychiatric disorders and adolescent cognitive and negative psychotic experiences, although not consistently across all sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, smoking and psychiatric disorders share genetic influences that cannot be attributed to covariates such as risk-taking, insomnia or other substance use. As such, there may be some common genetic pathways underlying smoking and psychiatric disorders. In addition, smoking may play a causal role in vulnerability for mental illness.",,,Scientific reports,11,1,14871,34290290,10.1038/s41598-021-93962-7,34290290,#518,,"",""

An alternative approach is to examine relationships among specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), selected a priori, and behavioural characteristics. Here, we adopt this strategy to examine relationships between three SNPs (5-HTTLPR, MAOA, COMT) and specific clinically-relevant behaviours that are phenotypic of fragile X syndrome (FXS) but vary in severity and frequency across individuals. Sixty-four males with FXS participated in the current study. Data from standardised informant measures of challenging behaviour (defined as physical aggression, property destruction, stereotyped behaviour, and self-injury), autism symptomatology, attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder characteristics, repetitive behaviour and mood/interest and pleasure were compared between each SNP genotype. No association was observed between behavioural characteristics and either 5-HTTLPR (serotonin) or MAOA (monoamine oxidase) genotypes. However, compared to the COMT (dopamine) AG and GG genotypes, the AA genotype was associated with greater interest and pleasure in the environment, and with reduced risk for property destruction, stereotyped behaviour and compulsive behaviour. The results suggest that common genetic variation in the COMT genotype affecting dopamine levels in the brain may contribute to the variability of challenging and repetitive behaviours and interest and pleasure in this population.

One such area of prevention research capitalizes on the relatively novel behavioral construct of food addiction, which has been implicated in obesity. Food addiction reflects an individual's propensity for compulsive eating despite negative consequences, and shares not only symptoms with both eating and substance use disorders but also genetic and neural correlates within neural reward-circuitry modulated by dopamine. Here, we examined associations between food addiction scores, body mass index (BMI), reward-related ventral striatum activity, and a polygenic score approximating dopamine signaling in 115 non-Hispanic Caucasian young adult university students. As predicted, polygenic dopamine scores were related to ventral striatum activity, which in turn was associated with higher food addiction scores. In addition, food addiction was related to BMI. An exploratory post-hoc path analysis further indicated that polygenic scores were indirectly related to both food addiction and BMI, in part, through ventral striatum activity.

Predictive links between genetic vulnerability to depression and trajectories of warmth and conflict in the mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relationships.,"Brouillard, Charlie; Brendgen, Mara; Vitaro, Frank; Dionne, Ginette; Boivin, Michel","The present study used a genetically informed design of twins raised in the same family (375 monozygotic and 290 dizygotic twins; 50.2% girls) to examine the association between adolescents' genetic risk for depressive symptoms and the course of the parent-child relationship quality throughout adolescence. Depressive symptoms and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationships were measured through adolescents' self-reports from ages 13 to 17. Group-based trajectory modeling revealed that most adolescents experienced high-quality relationships with both of their parents, characterized by high levels of warmth and low levels of conflict, and marked by gradual changes over adolescence. However, 3% of adolescents showed a trajectory of high and increasing conflict with their mothers and 16% of adolescents showed a trajectory of low warmth with their fathers, which decreased until mid-adolescence before increasing thereafter. Moreover, in line with an evocative gene-environment correlation process, a higher genetic vulnerability to depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of following a more problematic relationship trajectory with parents. This rGE was mediated by adolescents' actual depressive behavior symptoms.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these earlier developmental influences on cortisol reactivity to a social stress challenge and adolescent substance use (smoking, alcohol, and marijuana use frequency assessed at age 16 years), using data from the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS; N= 2230 adolescents, 51% female). Developmental pathways included polygenic risk, prenatal stress, warm parenting (age 11), and internalizing and externalizing problems (intercepts and change from 11-16 years). Cortisol reactivity was associated with smoking but not alcohol or marijuana use. Externalizing problems were the stronger predictor of adolescent substance use, but internalizing problems also had an important role. Prenatal stress and middle childhood parenting operated via middle childhood externalizing problems, and parenting also operated via trajectories of growth of externalizing problems in predicting adolescent substance use outcomes. Further, there were protective effects of internalizing problems for alcohol and marijuana use in the context of a more comprehensive model. These developmental influences did not attenuate the association of cortisol reactivity and smoking.

Here, we investigate genetic overlap between polygenic ADHD risk and multiple literacy-related and/or language-related abilities (LRAs), as assessed in UK children (N ≤ 5919), accounting for genetically predictable educational attainment (EA). Genome-wide summary statistics on clinical ADHD and years of schooling were obtained from large consortia (N ≤ 326,041). Our findings show that ADHD-polygenic scores (ADHD-PGS) were inversely associated with LRAs in ALSPAC, most consistently with reading-related abilities, and explained ≤1.6% phenotypic variation. These polygenic links were then dissected into both ADHD effects shared with and independent of EA, using multivariable regressions (MVR). Conditional on EA, polygenic ADHD risk remained associated with multiple reading and/or spelling abilities, phonemic awareness and verbal intelligence, but not listening comprehension and non-word repetition. Using conservative ADHD-instruments (P-threshold &amp;lt; 5 × 10 <sup>-8</sup> ), this corresponded, for example, to a 0.35 SD decrease in pooled reading performance per log-odds in ADHD-liability (P = 9.2 × 10 <sup>-5</sup> ).

However, polygenic ADHD-effects shared with EA were of equal strength and at least equal magnitude compared to those independent of EA, for all LRAs studied, and detectable using subthreshold instruments.

Association study and a systematic meta-analysis of the VNTR polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of dopamine transporter gene and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Grünblatt, Edna; Werling, Anna Maria; Roth, Alexander; Romanos, Marcel; Walitza, Susanne","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been postulated to associate with dopaminergic dysfunction, including the dopamine transporter (DAT1). Several meta-analyses showed small but significant association between the 10-repeat allele in the DAT1 gene in 3'-untranslated region variant number tandem repeat polymorphism and child and adolescent ADHD, whereas in adult ADHD the 9-repeat allele was suggested to confer as risk allele. Interestingly, recent evidence indicated that the long-allele variants (10 repeats and longer) might confer to lower expression of the transporter in comparison to the short-allele. Therefore, we assessed here the association in samples consisting of families with child and adolescent ADHD as well as a case-control sample, using either the 10- versus 9-repeat or the long- versus short-allele approach. Following, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including family and case-control studies, using the two aforementioned approaches as well as stratifying to age and ethnicity.

Interactive effect of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF polymorphisms on amygdala intrinsic functional connectivity and anxiety.,"Loewenstern, Joshua; You, Xiaozhen; Merchant, Junaid; Gordon, Evan M; Stollstorff, Melanie; Devaney, Joseph; Vaidya, Chandan J","The serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms have been associated with risk for affective disorders and functional variability of the amygdala. We examined whether the two genotypes interactively influence intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala and whether FC mediates the genetic association with anxiety. Eighty genotyped healthy adults underwent resting state fMRI and completed the self-reported State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Interactive genetic association with anxiety was observed such that effects of 5-HTTLPR depended on the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265 variant), with higher anxiety scores in short and Met carriers compared to the other allelic groups. Voxel-wise FC with left and right amygdala seeds identified regions that were sensitive to variability in anxiety scores. A significant moderated mediation model demonstrated that the effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on anxiety, moderated by BDNF Val66Met genotype, was fully mediated by FC between the left amygdala and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a cognitive control-related region, during a task-free state. FC was highest in carriers of the 5-HTTLPR short allele and BDNF Met allele.

However, it is unclear whether these associations are causal and whether they might be underpinned by other shared factors. To address this knowledge gap, we capitalized on the stability of genetic biomarkers through the lifetime, and on their unidirectional relationship with depression and cognition. Specifically, we determined the association between quantitative measures of cognitive function and depression and genetic instruments of insulin resistance traits in two large-scale population samples, the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS: SFHS; N = 19,994) and in the UK Biobank (N = 331,374). In the GS:SFHS, the polygenic risk score (PRS) for fasting insulin was associated with verbal intelligence and depression while the PRS for the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was associated with verbal intelligence. Despite this overlap in genetic architecture, Mendelian randomization analyses in the GS:SFHS and in the UK Biobank samples did not yield evidence for causal associations from insulin resistance traits to either depression or cognition. These findings may be due to weak genetic instruments, limited cognitive measures and insufficient power but they may also indicate the need to identify other biological mechanisms that may mediate the relationship from insulin resistance to depression and cognition.",2019,Jun,Experimental neurology,316,,20-26,30965038,10.1016/j.expneurol.2019.04.001,30965038,#618,Frangou 2019,"",""
Interaction effect of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) rs53576 genotype and maternal postpartum depression on child behavioural problems.,"Choi, Damee; Tsuchiya, Kenji J; Takei, Nori","Previous studies have reported interaction effects of oxytocin receptor genotype (rs53576) and environmental factors on mental health in youth. However, the findings are mixed, especially regarding the type of allele (i.e., A vs. G), and it remains unanswered whether such an interaction presents at an early stage of development. Thus, using a unique longitudinal birth cohort sample in Japan (n = 568), we examined whether there was an effect of the interaction between the OXTR rs53576 genotype and maternal postpartum depression, as an environmental risk, on behavioural problems in children. Child behavioural problems (internalising and externalising problems) were ascertained using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when children were 6 years old. Maternal postpartum depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale when children were at 2 months and 10 months of age. The results revealed a significant effect in the interaction between OXTR rs53576 genotype and maternal postpartum depression on externalising problems in children with AA genotype (β = 0.136, 95% CI 0.032 to 0.240), but not in those with GG/GA genotype. This indicates that an interaction of vulnerable genotypes (i.e., A allele of OXTR rs53576) with an environmental burden (i.e. maternal postpartum depression) may be one of the potential elements that predisposes the infant to developing behavioural problems early in life. Hence, special attention needs to be paid to children exposed to environmental risks such as maternal postpartum depression, to facilitate the provision of appropriate care.",,,Scientific reports,9,1,7685,31118457,10.1038/s41598-019-44175-6,31118457,#619,,"",""

A total of 1253 individuals from a cross-sectional population-based study were analyzed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.

However, treatment response during an initial therapeutic trial is often poor and is difficult to predict. Heterogeneity of response to SSRIs in depressed patients is partly driven by co-occurring somatic disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and obesity. CAD and obesity may also be associated with metabolic side effects of SSRIs. In this study, we assessed the association of CAD and obesity with treatment response to SSRIs in patients with MDD using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Additionally, we performed cross-trait meta-analyses to pinpoint genetic variants underpinnings the relationship of CAD and obesity with SSRIs treatment response. First, PGSs were calculated at different p value thresholds (P <sub>T</sub> ) for obesity and CAD. Next, binary logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association of the PGSs to SSRIs treatment response in a discovery sample (ISPC, N = 865), and in a replication cohort (STAR*D, N = 1,878). Finally, a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis was performed by combining summary statistics. We show that the PGSs for CAD and obesity were inversely associated with SSRIs treatment response. At the most significant thresholds, the PGS for CAD and body mass index accounted 1.3%, and 0.8% of the observed variability in treatment response to SSRIs, respectively. In the cross-trait meta-analyses, we identified (1) 14 genetic loci (including NEGR1, CADM2, PMAIP1, PARK2) that are associated with both obesity and SSRIs treatment response; (2) five genetic loci (LINC01412, PHACTR1, CDKN2B, ATXN2, KCNE2) with effects on CAD and SSRIs treatment response.

First, we use the BMI PGS as an IV and adjust for PGSs for other factors (depression and educational attainment) that may invalidate this IV. We find a large statistically significant effect of BMI on mental health for the elderly: a 5 kg/m <sup>2</sup> increase in BMI (a difference equivalent to moving from overweight to obese) increases the probability of depression by 29 %. In contrast, for young adults the IV estimates are statistically and economically insignificant. We show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for compliers on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution.

However, many patients treated with oseltamivir developed adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity, gastritis, and neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Mexican patients treated with oseltamivir and whether these ADRs are associated with SNPs of the genes involved in the metabolism, transport, and interactions of oseltamivir. This study recruited 310 Mexican patients with acute respiratory diseases and treated them with oseltamivir (75 mg/day for 5 days) because they were suspected to have influenza A/H1N1 virus infection. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviews. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probes. The association was assessed under genetic models with contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Out of 310 patients, only 38 (12.25%) presented ADRs to oseltamivir: hypersensitivity (1.9%), gastritis (10%), and depression and anxiety (0.9%).

A total of 344 twins (172 pairs; mean age 15.56 ± 5.62 years) enriched for ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions were examined. Medical history and current physical problems were collected with a validated questionnaire to determine twin's somatic health. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) was used to measure the participant's severity of autistic traits. Identified somatic health issues with significant within-twin pair differences were tested in relation to both ASD diagnosis and autistic traits in a co-twin control model. Twins with ASD exhibited more neurological and immunological health problems compared to those without ASD (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). The intra-pair differences of neurological conditions and SRS-2 score were significantly correlated in monozygotic twins differing for autism traits (r = 0.40, p = 0.001), while the correlation was not found for immunological problems. In addition, a conditional model for analysis of within-twin pair effects revealed an association between neurological problems and clinical ASD diagnosis (Odds ratio per neurological problem 3.15, p = 0.02), as well as autistic traits (β = 10.44, p = 0.006), after adjusting for possible effects of co-existing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and general intellectual abilities.

Multivariate structural equation modeling decomposed the correlations between these syndromes into genetic and environmental components to examine shared and specific risk domains. Irritability had significant associations with each internalizing symptom domain. Genetic contributions to irritability are moderately correlated with genetic risk for symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and separation anxiety with weaker overlap with the other anxiety syndromes.

It is important that genetic testing and counseling align with the interests of the patients, and these interests are likely to vary among countries and cultures. <b><i>Aim:</i></b> The present study aimed to compare the attitudes toward psychiatric genetic research and genetic testing in Denmark and Cuba. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> A survey, culturally adapted for each country, was administered to a pool of students, patients with depression, and the closest relatives of these patients. A total of 491 stakeholders from Denmark and 720 from Cuba were included in the study. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Significant differences between the two populations were found for general knowledge about psychiatric genetic research, whom to offer genetic testing, and to whom to entrust with psychiatric genetic information. Cuban stakeholders were more likely to feel uncomfortable about psychiatric genetic research than the Danish stakeholders. This difference might be driven by the characteristics of the health systems, sociocultural factors, and lower genetic literacy in the Cuban population. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study is the first to compare attitudes toward psychiatric genetic testing between a Latin American country and a Nordic country.

Here we investigate if sex and polymorphisms in Mn transporter genes SLC30A10 and SLC39A8 influence the association between Mn exposure and ADHD-related behavioral problems in children. The SNPs rs1776029 and rs12064812 in SLC30A10, and rs13107325 in SLC39A8 were genotyped by TaqMan PCR or pyrosequencing in a population of Italian children (aged 11-14 years; n = 645) with a wide range of environmental Mn exposure.

Linear regression models or generalized additive models (GAM) were used for analyzing associations between soil Mn and neurobehavioral problems assessed by the Conners' behavior rating scales (self-, and parent-reported). Gene-environment interactions (Mn transporter genotype x soil Mn) were evaluated using a genetic score in which genotypes for the three SNPs were combined based on their association with blood Mn, as an indication of their influence on Mn regulation. We observed differences in associations between soil Mn and neurobehavior between sexes. For several self-reported Conners' scales, girls showed U-shaped relationships with higher (worse) Conners' scoring at higher soil Mn levels, and several parent-reported scales showed positive linear relationships between increasing soil Mn and higher Conner's scores. For boys, we observed a positive linear relationship with soil Mn for one Conner's outcome only (hyperactivity, parent-reported). We also observed some interactions between soil Mn and the genetic score on Conner's scales in girls and girls with genotypes linked to high blood Mn showed particularly strong positive associations between soil Mn and parent-reported Conners' scales.

Association of maternal depression with children's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Sfelinioti, S; Livaditis, M","Family problems are considered to be the main risk factor leading to the development of behavi oural problems during childhood and adolescence as well. A well documented fact in the current literature is that psychopathology of any kind in parents may influence behaviour, personality and appearance of psychopathology in their children. The permanent interaction between children's psychopathology or any kind of developmental disorder on one hand and parental psychopathology on the other, is considered to be one of the most important fields of research during the last decades. The aim of the present study was to review research concerning the relationship between maternal depressive disorder and children's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among members of the same family, the influence that each disorder has in the appearance and development of the other, and the way that the mother-child relationship is influenced by both. We conducted an electronic search through PubMed to detect articles concerning the association of maternal depressive disorder and children's ADHD among the members of the same family published in English from January 1980 to December 2015. The choice was strictly limited to articles concerning exclusively emotional disorders in mothers and ADHD in their children. This process concluded with the electronic research of bibliographic citations of the identified articles, or related articles, in order to locate additional sources. Considering as a fact the interaction between this developmental disorder, ADHD, and mother's psychological profile which is maternal depression for the present research, we report the following: among the 27 articles found, 24 concerned the influence of the mother's depression to the child's ADHD, and the remaining 3 concerned their genetic association. There were important limitations found as well. Despite the fact that all the studies included a control group, many of them did have a follow-up and were short-term studies. Their results were mostly heterogenous and therefore their meta-analysis proved impossible. There was evidence concerning the association between the two disorders as both maternal depressive disorder and children's ADHD influence each other through multiple psychosocial and biological factors.

However, a high percentage of patients do not respond. There is a substantial genetic contribution to this variable clinical outcome. Based on previous genetic results of our group and given the lack of pharmacogenetics studies of antidepressant response with a long follow-up period, we evaluated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to the serotonergic pathway on remission and recovery in children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD after 12 months of initiating fluoxetine treatment. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The assessment was performed in 46 patients. All of them were visited at least once a month during the 12-month follow-up. Psychiatrists interviewed patients and their parents to explore clinical improvement. A total of 75 genotyped SNPs in 10 candidate genes were included in the genetic association analysis with remission and recovery. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied to avoid false positive results. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>HTR2A</i> rs7997012 SNP was significantly associated after Bonferroni correction with clinical improvement. Particularly, the homozygotes for the major allele (GG) showed the highest percentage of remitters and the highest score reductions on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale.

Target-related parietal P3 and medial frontal theta index the genetic risk for problematic substance use.,"Harper, Jeremy; Malone, Stephen M; Iacono, William G","Theoretical and empirical work suggests that problematic substance use (PSU) is associated with individual differences in prefrontal cortex activity. While research has strongly linked parietal P3 amplitude reduction (P3AR) to genetic risk for problematic substance use, few studies have tested whether prefrontal EEG measures are sensitive to this genetic liability. In addition to P3, oddball target detection tasks elicit medial frontal theta power, reflecting attentional allocation, and parietal delta, indexing decision making or stimulus-response link updating. Midfrontal theta and parietal delta may index neurocognitive processes relevant to PSU beyond P3AR. The present investigation examined the etiological relationship between PSU and P3, frontal theta, and parietal delta in a large twin sample (N = 754). EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task. Greater PSU was associated with reduced target P3 amplitude and midfrontal theta/parietal delta power, and increased mean reaction time and reaction time variability (RTV; indexing attentional fluctuations). P3, theta, and RTV, but not delta or mean RT, explained unique variance in PSU (R <sup>2</sup>  = 0.04). Twin biometric modeling indicated a genetic relationship between PSU and P3, theta, and RTV. Theta accounted for distinct genetic variance in PSU beyond P3 and RTV. Together, 23% of the total additive genetic variance in PSU was explained by the three endophenotypes. Results replicate P3AR as an endophenotype and provide support for additional behavioral (RTV) and neurophysiological (midfrontal theta) endophenotypes of PSU.

Path analyses revealed a significant indirect effect of IL18 risk haplotype on symptoms of depression and anxiety through increased threat-related amygdala reactivity. These results suggest that a common functional IL18 haplotype associated with heightened proinflammatory responses confers susceptibility to stress-related depression and anxiety through effects on threat-related amygdala function, a risk pathway specific to women.

The present study extended this research by examining whether family problem-solving interactions differ between clinical high-risk (CHR) stages of each illness. Trained coders applied a behavioral coding system (O'Brien et al., 2014) to problem-solving interactions of parents and their adolescent child, conducted just prior to beginning a randomized trial of family-focused therapy. The CHR for psychosis sample included 58 families with an adolescent with attenuated positive symptoms, brief intermittent psychosis, or genetic risk and functional deterioration; the CHR for bipolar disorder sample included 44 families with an adolescent with ""unspecified"" bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder and at least one first or second degree relative with bipolar I or II disorder. When controlling for adolescent gender, age, functioning, and parent education, mothers of youth at CHR for psychosis displayed significantly more conflictual and less constructive communication than did mothers of youth at CHR for bipolar disorder. Youth risk classification did not have a significant relationship with youths' or fathers' communication behavior. The family environment among help-seeking adolescents may be more challenging for families with an adolescent at CHR for psychosis compared with bipolar illness.

Up to 20% of BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant association after correction for multiple testing. Gene-based analysis yielded two significant genes: DPYD (P=4.42 × 10 <sup>-7</sup> ) and PKP4 (P=8.67 × 10 <sup>-7</sup> ); and gene-set analysis yielded a significant finding for exocytosis (GO:0006887, P <sub>FDR</sub> =0.019; FDR, false discovery rate). Prior studies have implicated DPYD, PKP4 and exocytosis in BIP and SCZ. The most notable finding of the present study was the genetic overlap of BOR with BIP (r <sub>g</sub> =0.28 [P=2.99 × 10 <sup>-3</sup> ]), SCZ (r <sub>g</sub> =0.34 [P=4.37 × 10 <sup>-5</sup> ]) and MDD (r <sub>g</sub> =0.57 [P=1.04 × 10 <sup>-3</sup> ]).

In addition to the published genome-wide significant genes, it is believed that there are undiscovered 'treasures' underlying the current MDD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and gene expression data sets, and digging into these data will allow better understanding of the illness and development of new therapeutic approaches. For this purpose, we performed a meta-analytic study combining three MDD GWAS data sets (23andMe, CONVERGE, and PGC), and then conducted independent replications of significant loci in two additional samples. The genome-wide significant variants then underwent explorative analyses on MDD-related phenotypes, cognitive function alterations, and gene expression in brains. In the discovery meta-analysis, a previously unidentified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9540720 in the PCDH9 gene was genome-wide significantly associated with MDD (p=1.69 × 10 <sup>-8</sup> in a total of 89 610 cases and 246 603 controls), and the association was further strengthened when additional replication samples were included (p=1.20 × 10 <sup>-8</sup> in a total of 136 115 cases and 355 275 controls). The risk SNP was also associated with multiple MDD-related phenotypes and cognitive function impairment in diverse samples. Intriguingly, the risk allele of rs9540720 predicted lower PCDH9 expression, consistent with the diagnostic analysis results that PCDH9 mRNA expression levels in the brain and peripheral blood tissues were reduced in MDD patients compared with healthy controls.

Rs2910164 in microRNA‑146a confers an elevated risk of depression in patients with coronary artery disease by modulating the expression of NOS1.,"Zhang, Xinling; Huo, Qianqian; Sun, Wei; Zhang, Chunxiang; Wu, Zongyin; Xing, Bing; Li, Qiang","Depression has been well established as an independent predictor of mortality and cardiac morbidity rates in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Evidence has shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms located in pre‑microRNA (miRNA) or mature miRNA may modify various biological processes and affect the process of carcinogenesis, and the downregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) can induce depression. It has been shown that NOS1 is the target gene of miR‑146a, and that the rs2910164 G/C polymorphism can downregulate the expression of miR‑146a. In the present study, computational analysis was used to identify the target of miR‑146a, and a luciferase reporter assay system was used to validate NOS1 as a target gene of miR‑146a. In addition, U251 cells were treated with miR‑146a mimics/inhibitors to verify the negative regulatory association between miR‑146a and NOS1. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blot analysis were used to estimate the mRNA expression of NOS1 and the expression of miR‑146a. The results showed that the 'seed sequence' was located within the 3'‑untranslated region of NOS1 by searching an online miRNA database (www.mirdb.org), and the luciferase reporter assay confirmed that NOS1 was a direct target gene of miR‑146a. It was also found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of NOS1 in U251 cells treated with miR‑146a mimics and NOS1 small interfering RNA were substantially downregulated, compared with cells treated with the scramble control. The cells treated with miR‑146a inhibitors showed increased expression of NOS1. In addition, the presence of a minor allele of the rs2910164 polymorphism was significantly associated with risk of depression in patients with CAD. Taken together, the findings indicated a decreased risk of depression in the patients with CAD who were carriers of the miR‑146a rs2910164 C allele, and this association may be attributed to its ability to compromise the expression of miR‑146a, and thereby increase the expression of its target gene, NOS1.",2018,Jul,Molecular medicine reports,18,1,603-609,29749487,10.3892/mmr.2018.8929,29749487,#738,Zhang 2018,"",""

We investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) to five facial expressions of basic emotion: fear, anger, disgust, sadness and happiness under both subliminal (masked) and conscious (unmasked) presentation conditions, and the source localization of group differences. In the conscious condition, controls showed a distinctly positive-going shift in responsive to negative versus happy faces, reflected in a greater positivity for the VPP frontally and the P300 parietally, and less negativity for the N200. By contrast, relatives showed less differentiation of emotions, reflected in less VPP and P300 positivity, particularly for anger and disgust, which produced an enhanced N200 for sadness. These group differences were consistently source localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. The findings contribute new evidence for neural disruptions underlying the differentiation of salient emotions in familial risk for depression.

Does cortisol moderate the environmental association between peer victimization and depression symptoms? A genetically informed twin study.,"Brendgen, Mara; Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle; Lupien, Sonia; Vitaro, Frank; Dionne, Ginette; Boivin, Michel","Many youths who are victimized by peers suffer from depression symptoms. However, not all bullying victims show depression symptoms and individuals' biological sensitivity may play an important moderating role in this regard. In line with this notion, peer victimization has been associated with increased depressive symptoms in youth with higher basal cortisol secretion. It is unclear, however, whether this moderating effect of cortisol really concerns the environmental effect of peer victimization on depression. Indeed, genetic factors can also influence individuals' environmental experiences, including peer victimization, and part of these genetic factors may be those associated with depression. Using a genetically informed design based on 159 monozygotic and 120 dizygotic twin pairs (52% girls) assessed at age 14 years, this study examined whether cortisol secretion moderates the environmental or the genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms. Salivary cortisol at awakening was obtained with buccal swabs during four school week days. Peer victimization and depression were assessed via self-reports. Cholesky modeling revealed that peer victimization was associated with depression symptoms via both genetic and environmental pathways. Moreover, the environmental association between peer victimization and depression symptoms steadily increased with increasing levels of morning cortisol. The genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms also varied, albeit less, as a function of individuals' cortisol secretion.

Because of this rarity, developing cohorts with enough individuals to robustly identify disease-associated genes is challenging. Social-media platforms that facilitate data sharing among sequencing labs can help to address this challenge. Through one such tool, GeneMatcher, we identified nine DD- and/or ID-affected probands with a rare, heterozygous variant in the gene encoding the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRSK2. All probands have a speech delay, and most present with intellectual disability, motor delay, behavioral issues, and autism. Six of the nine variants are predicted to result in loss of function, and computational modeling predicts that the remaining three missense variants are damaging to BRSK2 structure and function. All nine variants are absent from large variant databases, and BRSK2 is, in general, relatively intolerant to protein-altering variation among humans. In all six probands for whom parents were available, the mutations were found to have arisen de novo. Five of these de novo variants were from cohorts with at least 400 sequenced probands; collectively, the cohorts span 3,429 probands, and the observed rate of de novo variation in these cohorts is significantly higher than the estimated background-mutation rate (p = 2.46 × 10 <sup>-6</sup> ). We also find that exome sequencing provides lower coverage and appears less sensitive to rare variation in BRSK2 than does genome sequencing; this fact most likely reduces BRSK2's visibility in many clinical and research sequencing efforts.

While it has been shown that the variant that selectively enhances fronto-amygdala connectivity at rest is associated with decreased anxiety-like behaviors, no study so far has investigated whether this finding of FAAH-related differential plasticity extends to task-related differential functional expression and regulation during negative emotional processing. Using an imaging genetics approach, this study aimed to replicate and extend prior findings by examining functional activity and task-related connectivity in fronto-amygdala regions during emotion reactivity and emotional down-regulation of negative affect. Therefore, 48 healthy young adults underwent a functional MRI resting state measurement, completed an emotion regulation paradigm and provided self-reports on anxiety and use of emotion regulation strategies.

We found a significant interaction between BDNF Val66Met genotype group and image valence on post-sleep recognition performance. This interaction was driven by greater memory for negative and positive images, relative to neutral images, in Met carriers. We also found that longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep duration predicted greater post-sleep recognition performance for negative images in Met carriers, but not in Val homozygotes. We observed no influence of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on post- sleep recognition performance for positive, neutral or negative images. Our findings support a modulatory role for BDNF Val66Met in overnight emotional memory retention in females.

Serotonin functioning and adolescents' alcohol use: A genetically informed study examining mechanisms of risk.,"Wang, Frances L; Chassin, Laurie; Bates, John E; Dick, Danielle; Lansford, Jennifer E; Pettit, Gregory S; Dodge, Kenneth A","The current study used data from two longitudinal samples to test whether self-regulation, depressive symptoms, and aggression/antisociality were mediators in the relation between a polygenic score indexing serotonin (5-HT) functioning and alcohol use in adolescence. The results from an independent genome-wide association study of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid were used to create 5-HT polygenic risk scores. Adolescents and/or parents reported on adolescents' self-regulation (Time 1), depressive symptoms (Time 2), aggression/antisociality (Time 2), and alcohol use (Time 3). The results showed that 5-HT polygenic risk did not predict self-regulation. However, adolescents with higher levels of 5-HT polygenic risk showed greater depression and aggression/antisociality. Adolescents' aggression/antisociality mediated the relation between 5-HT polygenic risk and later alcohol use. Deficits in self-regulation also predicted depression and aggression/antisociality, and indirectly predicted alcohol use through aggression/antisociality. Pathways to alcohol use were especially salient for males from families with low parental education in one of the two samples. The results provide insights into the longitudinal mechanisms underlying the relation between 5-HT functioning and alcohol use (i.e., earlier aggression/antisociality).

In contrast, DNA-based 'SNP heritability' estimates are generally &amp;lt;15% and non-significant. One notable feature of emotional problems is that they can be somewhat transient, but the moderate stability seen across time and across raters is predominantly influenced by stable genetic influences. This suggests that by capturing what is in common across time and across raters, we might be more likely to tap into any underlying genetic vulnerability. We therefore hypothesised that a phenotype capturing the pervasive stability of emotional problems would show higher heritability. We fitted single-factor latent trait models using 12 emotional problems measures across ages 7, 12 and 16, rated by parents, teachers and children themselves in the Twins Early Development Study sample.

The current study examined how genetic and environmental influences on anxiety and depression differed by chronological age and pubertal status. We analyzed composite scores from child self-reports and parent informant-reports of internalizing symptomology in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1,913 individual twins from 1,006 pairs (ages 8-20 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Biometric models tested age and pubertal status as moderators of genetic and environmental influences shared between and specific to anxiety and depression to determine whether etiology of internalizing symptomology differs across development as a function of age or puberty. Genetic influences did not increase as a function of age or puberty, but instead shared environmental effects decreased with age. In an exploratory model that considered the moderators simultaneously, developmental differences in etiology were reflected in genetic and environmental effects unique to depression.

Similarly, using seeds in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), reduced connectivity was observed between IPS and frontal and cerebellar regions. Finally, we observed a brain-behavior correlation between IPS-cerebellar connectivity and cognitive attention measures.

However, alcohol misuse is modestly heritable and involves differing etiological pathways. Externalizing disorders show significant genetic overlap with substance use, suggesting an impulsivity pathway to alcohol misuse. Alcohol misuse also overlaps with internalizing disorders, suggesting alcohol is used to cope. These differing pathways could lead to different patterns over time and/or differential susceptibility to environmental conditions, such as childhood SES. We examine whether: 1) genetic risk for externalizing and internalizing disorders influence trajectories of alcohol problems across adolescence to adulthood, 2) childhood SES alters genetic risk these disorders on trajectories of alcohol problems, and 3) these patterns are consistent across sex. We find modest evidence of gene-environment interaction. Higher childhood SES increases the risk of alcohol problems in late adolescence/early adulthood, while lower childhood SES increases the risk of alcohol problems in later adulthood, but only among males at greater genetic risk of externalizing disorders.

Consistent altered functional connectivity was found with the bilateral insula: for the left supplementary motor area and the left superior temporal gyrus with the cross-disorder PGRS, for the left insula and right middle and superior temporal lobe associated with the PGRS for autism, for the bilateral midbrain, posterior cingulate, cuneus, and precuneus associated with the PGRS for BD, and for the left angular gyrus and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with the PGRS for schizophrenia. No significant functional connectivity was found associated with the PGRS for ADHD and MDD. Our findings indicated that genetic effects on the cross-disorder and disorder-specific neural connectivity of common genetic risk loci are detectable in the general population. Our findings also indicated that polygenic risk contributes to the main neurobiological phenotypes of psychiatric disorders and that identifying cross-disorder and specific functional connectivity related to polygenic risks may elucidate the neural pathways for these disorders.",,,NeuroImage.

DRD4 Variants Moderate the Impact of Parental Characteristics on Child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Exploratory Evidence from a Multiplex Family Design.,"Nikolas, Molly A; Momany, Allison M","Parental ADHD symptomatology and related impairments have been robustly associated with youth ADHD across decades of work. Notably, these factors may impede typical development of child self-regulation capabilities through both neurobiological and interpersonal processes. High heritability of estimates for the disorder further suggest that these effects are likely genetically-mediated, at least in part. Variation within the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) has been shown to moderate parental influences on youth ADHD. Use of a multiplex family design (i.e., samples of families that included multiple affected members) may facilitate identification of additional gene variants of interest and advance understanding of gene-environment interplay in regard to parenting. Thirty multiplex families consisting of 114 individuals (66 youth, 48 parents) completed a multi-stage, multi-informant diagnostic and neurocognitive assessment, measures of parenting, and provided saliva samples for DNA analyses. Sanger sequencing of the DRD4 gene yielded 16 rare variants; a polygenic risk score was computed for both parents and youth. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) examined the predictive effects of parental ADHD symptoms, parental neurocognitive functioning, and poor parenting dimensions on youth ADHD as well as moderation of these effects by parental and youth DRD4 variants. Findings indicated that parental DRD4 variants moderated the impact of parental ADHD and neurocognitive functioning on youth ADHD symptoms. Youth DRD4 variants moderated the impact of parental inconsistent discipline on child ADHD. In all cases, stronger associations were observed for those individuals with more risk variants.

Epigenetic basis of the dark side of alcohol addiction.,"Pandey, Subhash C; Kyzar, Evan J; Zhang, Huaibo","Alcoholism is a complex brain disease characterized by three distinct stages of the addiction cycle that manifest as neuroadaptive changes in the brain. One such stage of the addiction cycle is alcohol withdrawal and the negative affective states that promote drinking and maintain addiction. Repeated alcohol use, genetic predisposition to alcoholism and anxiety, and alcohol exposure during crucial developmental periods all contribute to the development of alcohol-induced withdrawal and negative affective symptoms. Epigenetic modifications within the amygdala have provided a molecular basis of these negative affective symptoms, also known as the dark side of addiction. Here, we propose that allostatic change within the epigenome in the amygdala is a prime mechanism of the biological basis of negative affective states resulting from, and contributing to, alcoholism. Acute alcohol exposure produces an anxiolytic response which is associated with the opening of chromatin due to increased histone acetylation, increased CREB binding protein (CBP) levels, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. After chronic ethanol exposure, these changes return to baseline along with anxiety-like behaviors. However, during withdrawal, histone acetylation decreases due to increased HDAC activity and decreased CBP levels in the amygdala circuitry leading to the development of anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, innately higher expression of the HDAC2 isoform leads to a deficit in global and gene-specific histone acetylation in the amygdala that is associated with a decrease in the expression of several synaptic plasticity-associated genes and maintaining heightened anxiety-like behavior and excessive alcohol intake. Adolescent alcohol exposure also leads to higher expression of HDAC2 and a deficit in histone acetylation leading to decreased expression of synaptic plasticity-associated genes and high anxiety and drinking behavior in adulthood. All these studies indicate that the epigenome can undergo allostatic reprogramming in the amygdaloid circuitry during various stages of alcohol exposure. Furthermore, opening the chromatin by inhibiting HDACs using pharmacological or genetic manipulations can lead to the attenuation of anxiety as well as alcohol intake. Chromatin remodeling provides a clear biological basis for the negative affective states seen during alcohol addiction and presents opportunities for novel drug development and treatment options.

Internet addiction and its facets: The role of genetics and the relation to self-directedness.,"Hahn, Elisabeth; Reuter, Martin; Spinath, Frank M; Montag, Christian","A growing body of research focuses on problematic behavior patterns related to the use of the Internet to identify contextual as well as individual risk factors of this new phenomenon called Internet addiction (IA). IA can be described as a multidimensional syndrome comprising aspects such as craving, development of tolerance, loss of control and negative consequences. Given that previous research on other addictive behaviors showed substantial heritability, it can be expected that the vulnerability to IA may also be due to a person's genetic predisposition. However, it is questionable whether distinct components of IA have different etiologies. Using data from a sample of adult monozygotic and dizygotic twins and non-twin siblings (N=784 individuals, N=355 complete pairs, M=30.30years), we investigated the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on generalized IA as well as on specific facets such as excessive use, self-regulation, preference for online social interaction or negative consequences. To explain the heritability in IA, we further examined the relation to Self-Directedness as potential mediating source. Results showed that relative contributions of genetic influences vary considerable for different components of IA. For generalized IA factors, individual differences could be explained by shared and non-shared environmental influences while genetic influences did not play a role. For specific facets of IA and private Internet use in hours per week, heritability estimates ranged between 21% and 44%.

Peer Victimization and Anxiety in Genetically Vulnerable Youth: The Protective Roles of Teachers' Self-Efficacy and Anti-Bullying Classroom Rules.,"Guimond, Fanny-Alexandra; Brendgen, Mara; Vitaro, Frank; Dionne, Ginette; Boivin, Michel","Many victimized youngsters are at risk of developing internalizing problems, and this risk seems to be especially pronounced when they are genetically vulnerable for these problems. It is unclear, however, whether protective features of the school environment such as anti-bullying classroom policies and teacher's perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations can mitigate these negative outcomes. Using a genetically informed design based on twins, this study examined the potential moderating role of classroom anti-bullying policies and teachers' perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations in regard to the additive and interactive effects of peer victimization and genetic vulnerability on anxiety symptoms. To this end, 208 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins (120 girls) rated their level of anxiety and peer victimization in grade 6 (mean age = 12.1 years, SD = 2.8). Teachers rated their self-efficacy in handling bullying situations and the extent of anti-bullying classroom policies. Multilevel regressions revealed triple interactions showing that genetic disposition for anxiety predicted actual anxiety for twins who were highly victimized by their peers, but only when their teachers had low perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations or when anti-bullying classroom rules were absent or rarely enforced. In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms. Anti-bullying programs should continue to promote teachers' involvement, as well as the enforcement of anti-bullying classroom policies, in order to diminish peer victimization and its related consequences.",2015,Aug,Journal of abnormal child psychology,43,6,1095-1106,25772425,10.1007/s10802-015-0001-3,25772425,#860,Guimond 2015,"",""

The main hypothesis of the study was that subjects homozygous for the variant 3435T in ABCB1 (rs1045642) occur more frequently in DOA than in LOA and HV because morphine and methadone more readily cross the blood barrier in these subjects due to a lower efflux transporter activity of the ABCB1 (p-glycoprotein) transporter.

Circadian Clock Model Supports Molecular Link Between PER3 and Human Anxiety.,"Liberman, Amanda R; Kwon, Soo Bin; Vu, Ha T; Filipowicz, Allan; Ay, Ahmet; Ingram, Krista K","Generalized anxiety and major depression have become increasingly common in the United States, affecting 18.6 percent of the adult population. Mood disorders can be debilitating, and are often correlated with poor general health, life dissatisfaction, and the need for disability benefits due to inability to work. Recent evidence suggests that some mood disorders have a circadian component, and disruptions in circadian rhythms may even trigger the development of these disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms of this interaction are not well understood. Polymorphisms in a circadian clock-related gene, PER3, are associated with behavioral phenotypes (extreme diurnal preference in arousal and activity) and sleep/mood disorders, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Here we show that two PER3 mutations, a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) allele and a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), are associated with diurnal preference and higher Trait-Anxiety scores, supporting a role for PER3 in mood modulation. In addition, we explore a potential mechanism for how PER3 influences mood by utilizing a comprehensive circadian clock model that accurately predicts the changes in circadian period evident in knock-out phenotypes and individuals with PER3-related clock disorders.",,,Scientific reports,7,1,9893,28860482,10.1038/s41598-017-07957-4,28860482,#872,,"",""

NLGN2 is strongly linked to inhibitory, GABAergic signaling and is crucial for maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain. Disruption of the excitation-inhibition balance is associated with neuropsychiatric disease. In animal models, altered NLGN2 expression causes anxiety, developmental delay, motor discoordination, social impairment, aggression, and sensory processing defects. In humans, mutations in NLGN3 and NLGN4 are linked to autism and schizophrenia; NLGN2 missense variants are implicated in schizophrenia. Copy number variants encompassing NLGN2 on 17p13.1 are associated with autism, intellectual disability, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and dysmorphic features, but an isolated NLGN2 nonsense variant has not yet been described in humans.

This implies that within the same ancestry, the WGS data of an individual can be used to check whether this individual is within or closer to MDD subjects or to controls.

A Group x Genotype interaction was observed for both the amygdala and anterior insula in a paradigm designed to elicit responses in these brain areas during the anticipation of and response to aversive pictures. Patients who are S/L(G) carriers showed less activity than their L(A)/L(A) counterparts in both regions and less activity than S/L(G) healthy comparison subjects in the amygdala. Moreover, patients with greater insula responses reported higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty, an association that was particularly pronounced for patients with two LA alleles.

Clues from postmortem brain gene expression data.,"Hess, J L; Akutagava-Martins, G C; Patak, J D; Glatt, S J; Faraone, S V","Sub-cortical volumetric differences were associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a recent multi-site, mega-analysis of 1713 ADHD persons and 1529 controls. As there was a wide range of effect sizes among the sub-cortical volumes, it is possible that selective neuronal vulnerability has a role in these volumetric losses. To address this possibility, we used data from Allen Brain Atlas to investigate variability in gene expression profiles between subcortical regions of typically developing brains. We tested the hypothesis that the expression of genes in a set of curated ADHD candidate genes and five a priori selected, biological pathways would be associated with the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) findings. Across the subcortical regions studied by ENIGMA, gene expression profiles for three pathways were significantly correlated with ADHD-associated volumetric reductions: apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy. These correlations were strong and significant for children with ADHD, but not for adults. Although preliminary, these data suggest that variability of structural brain anomalies in ADHD can be explained, in part, by the differential vulnerability of these regions to mechanisms mediating apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy.",2018,Aug,Molecular psychiatry,23,8,1787-1793,29180674,10.1038/mp.2017.242,29180674,#900,Hess 2018,"",""

Moreover, assuming this is so, siblings' schizotypy class membership should be predicted by probands' familial load for psychotic disorder and clinical severity, consistent with a multifactorial polygenic threshold model of schizophrenia. We tested these hypotheses in the Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP) Study where siblings of probands (n = 792) and unaffected controls (n = 559) provided self-report ratings on the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). Maximum covariance analyses of control group ratings led to the identification of CAPE items sensitive to nonredundant positive and negative schizotypy classes in the control group (prevalence = 7.9% and 11.1%, respectively). When the same taxonic solution was applied to siblings' CAPE rating, taxometric analyses yielded evidence for larger positive and negative schizotypy classes among siblings (prevalence = 14.1% and 21.8%, respectively). Whereas probands' familial loads for bipolar disorder or drug use disorders did not predict siblings' membership in the schizotypy classes, probands' familial load for psychotic disorder did. Siblings were more likely to be members of the positive schizotypy class where their probands were more severely affected.

Glutamatergic neurosystem genes have been implicated in the neurobiology of depression in SLE and suicidal behaviour in general. However, the role of glutamate receptor gene polymorphisms in suicidal behaviour among SLE patients remains unclear in the context of established clinical and psychosocial factors. We aimed to investigate the association of NR2A gene polymorphism with suicidal ideation in SLE while accounting for the interaction between clinical and psychosocial factors. Methods A total of 130 SLE patients were assessed for mood disorders (MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview), severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), suicidal behaviour (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale), socio-occupational functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), recent life events (Social Readjustment Rating Scale) and lupus disease activity (SELENA-SLE Disease Activity Index). Eighty-six out of the 130 study participants consented for NR2A genotyping. Results Multivariable logistic regression showed nominal significance for the interaction effect between the NR2A rs2072450 AC genotype and higher severity of socio-occupational impairment with lifetime suicidal ideation in SLE patients ( p = 0.038, odds ratio = 1.364, 95% confidence interval = 1.018-1.827).

The impact of genetic variation on brain function can be investigated with intermediate phenotypes. A suggested intermediate phenotype of MDD is emotion recognition: The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of SLC6A4 as well as other serotonergic genes have been associated with amygdala and prefrontal function during emotion recognition.

However, some ACoA are resilient to these negative outcomes. The goal of this study was to better understand the psychobiological factors that distinguish resilient and vulnerable college-aged ACoAs. To do so, scholastic performance and psychological health were measured in ACoA college students not engaged in hazardous alcohol use (resilient) and those currently engaged in hazardous alcohol use (vulnerable). Neural activity (as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging) in response to performing working memory and emotion-based tasks were assessed. Furthermore, the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with substance use, risk taking and stress reactivity were compared between the two ACoA groups.

A case-control study was conducted with children aged 6-18years old, consisting of 389 children newly diagnosed with ADHD via the DSM-IV at the Wuhan Women and Children Medical Care Center, and 393 control participants were healthy children for physical examination during the same period. All participants were tested using the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and Parent Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ). Furthermore, a self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the general situation and related environmental factors, and the BLLs were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The genotyping was performed using Sequenom MassArray. In our study, PIK3CG gene rs12667819 was consistently shown to be associated with ADHD risk in dominant model (OR=1.656, 95% CI=1.229-2.232), ADHD-I type (OR=2.278, 95% CI=1.666-4.632), and symptom scores. Moreover, rs12536620 has been observed to be related to ADHD-C type and symptom scores. Intriguingly, gene-environmental interactions analysis consistently revealed the potential interactions of rs12667819 collaborating with blood lead (P <sub>mul</sub> =0.045) and feeding style (P <sub>mul</sub> =0.041) to modify ADHD risk.

We studied 1 899 654 individuals born in Sweden between 1987 and 2006. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between clinically ascertained ASD and ADHD in individuals and in families. Stratified estimates were obtained for ASD with (low-functioning) and without (high-functioning) intellectual disability. Individuals with ASD were at higher risk of having ADHD compared with individuals who did not have ASD (odds ratio (OR)=22.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 21.77-22.92).

Symptoms of ASD typically occur during early childhood, whereas most symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia do not appear before early adulthood. We investigated whether overlap in common genetic influences between these clinical conditions and impairments in social communication depends on the developmental stage of the assessed trait. Social communication difficulties were measured in typically-developing youth (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, N⩽5553, longitudinal assessments at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years) using the Social Communication Disorder Checklist.

Overlap in genetic influences between ASD and social communication difficulties during development decreased with age, both in the PGC-ASD and the iPSYCH-ASD sample. Genetic overlap between schizophrenia and social communication difficulties, by contrast, persisted across age, as observed within two independent PGC-SCZ2 subsamples, and showed an increase in magnitude for traits assessed during later adolescence. ASD- and schizophrenia-related polygenic effects were unrelated to each other and changes in trait-disorder links reflect the heterogeneity of genetic factors influencing social communication difficulties during childhood versus later adolescence.

ADHD impacts not only the affected individuals but also their families and social and professional networks. The clinical and diagnostic criteria for ADHD remain imprecise, in part, due to lack of robust biomarkers. ADHD comprises multiple subsets of diseases that present a shared set of downstream clinical findings, while displaying extensive molecular heterogeneity. This calls for innovation in diagnostic strategies that can help establish an ADHD diagnosis unequivocally as well as guiding precision medicine in this common mental health disorder. No study has examined, to the best of our knowledge, the upstream regulation of miRNAs that impact the downstream final ADHD phenotype. The latter focus on putative genetic biomarkers that regulate the regulators and can be tested empirically, for example, through genetic association analyses of the biogenesis pathways for miRNAs that impact the ADHD phenotype.

Heritability of brain activity related to response inhibition: A longitudinal genetic study in adolescent twins.,"Anokhin, Andrey P; Golosheykin, Simon; Grant, Julia D; Heath, Andrew C","The ability to inhibit prepotent but context- or goal-inappropriate responses is essential for adaptive self-regulation of behavior. Deficits in response inhibition, a key component of impulsivity, have been implicated as a core dysfunction in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and addictions. Identification of genetically transmitted variation in the neural underpinnings of response inhibition can help to elucidate etiological pathways to these disorders and establish the links between genes, brain, and behavior. However, little is known about genetic influences on the neural mechanisms of response inhibition during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by weak self-regulation of behavior. Here we investigated heritability of ERPs elicited in a Go/No-Go task in a large sample of adolescent twins assessed longitudinally at ages 12, 14, and 16. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of inhibition-related frontal N2 and P3 components at all three ages, with 50 to 60% of inter-individual variability being attributable to genetic factors. These genetic influences included both common genetic factors active at different ages and novel genetic influences emerging during development. Finally, individual differences in the rate of developmental changes from age 12 to age 16 were significantly influenced by genetic factors.

Development and genetics of brain temporal stability related to attention problems in adolescent twins.,"Smit, Dirk J A; Anokhin, Andrey P","The brain continuously develops and reorganizes to support an expanding repertoire of behaviors and increasingly complex cognition. These processes may, however, also result in the appearance or disappearance of specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention problems. To investigate whether brain activity changed during adolescence, how genetics shape this change, and how these changes were related to attention problems, we measured EEG activity in 759 twins and siblings, assessed longitudinally in four waves (12, 14, 16, and 18years of age). Attention problems were assessed with the SWAN at waves 12, 14, and 16. To characterize functional brain development, we used a measure of temporal stability (TS) of brain oscillations over the recording time of 5min reflecting the tendency of a brain to maintain the same oscillatory state for longer or shorter periods. Increased TS may reflect the brain's tendency to maintain stability, achieve focused attention, and thus reduce ""mind wandering"" and attention problems. The results indicate that brain TS is increased across the scalp from 12 to 18. TS showed large individual differences that were heritable. Change in TS (alpha oscillations) was heritable between 12 and 14 and between 14 and 16 for the frontal brain areas. Absolute levels of brain TS at each wave were positively correlated with attention problems but not significantly. High and low attention problems subjects showed different developmental trajectories in TS, which was significant in a cluster of frontal leads. These results indicate that trajectories in brain TS development are a biomarker for the developing brain. TS in brain oscillations is highly heritable, and age-related change in TS is also heritable in selected brain areas.

Executive functions and substance use: Relations in late adolescence and early adulthood.,"Gustavson, Daniel E; Stallings, Michael C; Corley, Robin P; Miyake, Akira; Hewitt, John K; Friedman, Naomi P","Poor executive functions (EFs) have been linked to substance use and abuse across multiple substances. However, it is unclear whether these associations are stronger for some EFs over others and/or some stages of substance use over others (e.g., ever using substances vs. dependence). It is also unknown whether such patterns change from adolescence to early adulthood, a transition that is characterized by changes to both EFs and substance use behaviors. In this longitudinal study of approximately 850 twins, we examined the relations between multiple EF abilities (including a common EF factor predicting 9 EF tasks) and measures of general substance use and dependence/abuse in late adolescence (mean age 17 years) and early adulthood (mean age 23 years). At the phenotypic level, common EF in adolescence was negatively related to the number of substances ever used and to last 6-month frequency of use, but not to dependence/abuse vulnerability (i.e., the number of dependence and abuse symptoms endorsed per substance that had been repeatedly used). However, in the same participants in early adulthood, common EF was only weakly related to the number of substances used, and not related to concurrent frequency of use nor dependence/abuse vulnerability. Twin analyses revealed that these associations were primarily genetic in origin, and that the genetic correlations were relatively stable over time. These results suggest that low common EF is a genetic risk factor for increased polysubstance use in late adolescence, but that non-EF factors play a larger role in the progression to substance dependence/abuse.

In contrast, results for cognitive and anthropometric traits were more typical (average twin and SNP heritabilities were 0.58 and 0.28, respectively).

We genotyped the subjects genome-wide and then used a hierarchical approach in which we tested seven a priori single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with stop signal task performance, approximately 9,000 SNPs designated as high-value addiction (HVA) markers by the SmokeScreen array, and approximately five million genotyped and imputed SNPs, followed by a gene-based association analysis using the resultant p values. A priori SNP analyses revealed nominally significant associations between response inhibition and one locus in HTR2A (rs6313; p = .04, dominance model, uncorrected) in the same direction as prior findings. A nominally significant association was also found in one locus in ANKK1 (rs1800497; p = .03, uncorrected), although in the opposite direction of previous reports. After accounting for multiple comparisons, the HVA, genome-wide, and gene-based analyses yielded no significant findings. This study implicates variation in serotonergic and dopaminergic genes while underscoring the difficulty of detecting the influence of individual SNPs, even when biological information is used to prioritize testing. Although such small effect sizes suggest limited utility of individual SNPs in predicting risk for addiction or other impulse control disorders, they may nonetheless shed light on complex biological processes underlying poor inhibitory control.

Eye tracking indices of attentional bias in children of depressed mothers: Polygenic influences help to clarify previous mixed findings.,"Owens, Max; Harrison, Ashley J; Burkhouse, Katie L; McGeary, John E; Knopik, Valerie S; Palmer, Rohan H C; Gibb, Brandon E","Information-processing biases may contribute to the intergenerational transmission of depression. There is growing evidence that children of depressed mothers exhibit attentional biases for sad faces. However, findings are mixed as to whether this bias reflects preferential attention toward, versus attentional avoidance of, sad faces, suggesting the presence of unmeasured moderators. To address these mixed findings, we focused on the potential moderating role of genes associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity. Participants included children (8-14 years old) of mothers with (n = 81) and without (n = 81) a history of depression. Eye movements were recorded while children passively viewed arrays of angry, happy, sad, and neutral faces. DNA was obtained from buccal cells. Children of depressed mothers exhibited more sustained attention to sad faces than did children of nondepressed mothers. However, it is important that this relation was moderated by children's genotype. Specifically, children of depressed mothers who carried reactive genotypes across the corticotropin-releasing hormone type 1 receptor (CHRH1) TAT haplotype and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) rs1360780 (but not the solute carrier family C6 member 4 [SLC6A4] of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]) exhibited less sustained attention to sad faces and more sustained attention to happy faces.

With an estimated heritability of about 40%, genetics is important in its development. We performed an exploratory genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of childhood aggressiveness in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to gain insight into the underlying biological processes associated with this trait. Our primary sample consisted of 1,060 adult ADHD patients (aADHD). To further explore the genetic architecture of childhood aggressiveness, we performed enrichment analyses of suggestive genome-wide associations observed in aADHD among GWA signals of dimensions of oppositionality (defiant/vindictive and irritable dimensions) in childhood ADHD (cADHD). No single polymorphism reached genome-wide significance (P &amp;lt; 5.00E-08). The strongest signal in aADHD was observed at rs10826548, within a long noncoding RNA gene (beta = -1.66, standard error (SE) = 0.34, P = 1.07E-06), closely followed by rs35974940 in the neurotrimin gene (beta = 3.23, SE = 0.67, P = 1.26E-06). The top GWA SNPs observed in aADHD showed significant enrichment of signals from both the defiant/vindictive dimension (Fisher's P-value = 2.28E-06) and the irritable dimension in cADHD (Fisher's P-value = 0.0061).

Multiple mechanisms, including diathesis-stress (vulnerability) and differential susceptibility Gene × Environment interaction effects (G × E), have been proposed to account for this association. G × E effects for ADHD were examined via interactions between a genetic marker hypothesized to influence sensitivity to the environment (the promoter polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene -5HTTLPR) and family conflict and cohesion in predicting ADHD symptoms. There were 498 youth ages 6-17 years (251 ADHD, 213 non-ADHD) and their parents who completed a multistage, multi-informant assessment (including parent and youth reports on the Family Environment Scale), and saliva sample collection for genotyping. Linear regression analyses examined interactions between 5HTTLPR genotype and the Family Environment Scale scales of conflict and cohesion reported by parent and child. Criteria laid out by Roisman et al. ( 2012 ) were applied to evaluate diathesis stress versus differential susceptibility G × E mechanisms. Results demonstrated interactions between 5HTTLPR genotype and both conflict and cohesion in predicting inattention but not hyperactivity-impulsivity. Both interactions were highly consistent with differential susceptibility models of G × E effects. 5HTTLPR genotype appeared to moderate the relationship between family conflict/cohesion and inattentive symptoms.

Associations were specific to the neonatal period and not observed at age 7. Key annotated genes included PACSIN1, NEUROD4 and NTRK2, implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. Several of the identified loci were associated with known methylation quantitative trait loci, and consequently likely to be under significant genetic control. Collectively, these 65 loci were also found to partially mediate the effect of prenatal maternal tobacco smoking on adolescent substance use. Together, findings lend novel insights into epigenetic correlates of substance use, highlight birth as a potentially sensitive window of biological vulnerability and provide preliminary evidence of an indirect epigenetic pathway linking prenatal tobacco exposure and adolescent substance use.",,,Translational psychiatry,6,12,e976,27922636,10.1038/tp.2016.247,27922636,#980,,"",""

More recently, the heritability of MDD has been estimated on large populations from registries such as the Swedish, Finnish, and Chinese cohorts. Family-based designs utilise a number of different relationships and provide an alternative means of estimating heritability. Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) is a large (n = 20,198), family-based population study designed to identify the genetic determinants of common diseases, including Major Depressive Disorder. Two thousand seven hundred and six individuals were SCID diagnosed with MDD, 13.5% of the cohort, from which we inferred a population prevalence of 12.2% (95% credible interval: 11.4% to 13.1%). Increased risk of MDD was associated with being female, unemployed due to a disability, current smokers, former drinkers, and living in areas of greater social deprivation. The heritability of MDD in GS:SFHS was between 28% and 44%, estimated from a pedigree model. The genetic correlation of MDD between sexes, age of onset, and illness course were examined and showed strong genetic correlations. The genetic correlation between males and females with MDD was 0.75 (0.43 to 0.99); between earlier (≤ age 40) and later (&amp;gt; age 40) onset was 0.85 (0.66 to 0.98); and between single and recurrent episodic illness course was 0.87 (0.72 to 0.98).

The study confirms a moderate genetic contribution to depression, with a small contribution of the common family environment (variance proportion = 0.07, CI: 0.01 to 0.15), and supports the relationship of MDD with previously identified risk factors. This study did not find robust support for genetic differences in MDD due to sex, age of onset, or illness course.

Distal and proximal environmental stress factors were also included in our analysis, namely childhood adversity and recent negative life-events. We found that rs16944 minor (A) allele specifically interacted with childhood adversity increasing depressive and anxiety symptoms, while rs1143643's minor (A) allele showed protective effect against depressive symptoms after recent life stress. The genetic main effects of the two SNPs were not significant in the main analysis, but the interaction effects remained significant after correction for multiple testing. In addition, the effect of rs16944 A allele was reversed in a subsample with low-exposure to life stress, suggesting a protective effect against depressive symptoms, in the post hoc analysis. In summary, both of the two IL1B SNPs showed specific environmental stressor-dependent effects on mood disorder symptoms.

Gene-set and multivariate genome-wide association analysis of oppositional defiant behavior subtypes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Aebi, Marcel; van Donkelaar, Marjolein M J; Poelmans, Geert; Buitelaar, Jan K; Sonuga-Barke, Edmund J S; Stringaris, Argyris; Consortium, Image; Faraone, Stephen V; Franke, Barbara; Steinhausen, Hans-Christoph; van Hulzen, Kimm J E","Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a frequent psychiatric disorder seen in children and adolescents with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ODD is also a common antecedent to both affective disorders and aggressive behaviors. Although the heritability of ODD has been estimated to be around 0.60, there has been little research into the molecular genetics of ODD. The present study examined the association of irritable and defiant/vindictive dimensions and categorical subtypes of ODD (based on latent class analyses) with previously described specific polymorphisms (DRD4 exon3 VNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and seven OXTR SNPs) as well as with dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin genes and pathways in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD. In addition, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the aforementioned ODD dimensions and subtypes. Apart from adjusting the analyses for age and sex, we controlled for ""parental ability to cope with disruptive behavior."" None of the hypothesis-driven analyses revealed a significant association with ODD dimensions and subtypes. Inadequate parenting behavior was significantly associated with all ODD dimensions and subtypes, most strongly with defiant/vindictive behaviors. In addition, the GWAS did not result in genome-wide significant findings but bioinformatics and literature analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by 28 of the 53 top-ranked genes functionally interact in a molecular landscape centered around Beta-catenin signaling and involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of ODD and inform future genetic studies of oppositional behavior. © 2015 The Authors.

Occasional cannabis use can progress to frequent use, abuse and dependence with all known adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. Individual differences in cannabis initiation are heritable (40-48%). The International Cannabis Consortium was established with the aim to identify genetic risk variants of cannabis use. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data of 13 cohorts (N=32 330) and four replication samples (N=5627). In addition, we performed a gene-based test of association, estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and explored the genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and cigarette use using LD score regression. No individual SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Nonetheless, gene-based tests identified four genes significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use: NCAM1, CADM2, SCOC and KCNT2. Previous studies reported associations of NCAM1 with cigarette smoking and other substance use, and those of CADM2 with body mass index, processing speed and autism disorders, which are phenotypes previously reported to be associated with cannabis use. Furthermore, we showed that, combined across the genome, all common SNPs explained 13-20% (P&amp;lt;0.001) of the liability of lifetime cannabis use. Finally, there was a strong genetic correlation (rg=0.83; P=1.85 × 10(-8)) between lifetime cannabis use and lifetime cigarette smoking implying that the SNP effect sizes of the two traits are highly correlated. This is the largest meta-analysis of cannabis GWA studies to date, revealing important new insights into the genetic pathways of lifetime cannabis use.

This association was later extended to schizophrenia and major depression. However, the neurobiological underpinnings of these associations are poorly understood. NCAN is implicated in neuronal plasticity and expressed in subcortical brain areas, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, which are critically involved in dysfunctional emotion processing and regulation across diagnostic boundaries. We hypothesized that the NCAN risk variant is associated with reduced gray matter volumes in these areas. Gray matter structure was assessed by voxel-based morphometry on structural MRI data in two independent German samples (healthy subjects, n=512; depressed inpatients, n=171). All participants were genotyped for NCAN rs1064395. Hippocampal and amygdala region-of-interest analyses were performed within each sample. In addition, whole-brain data from the combined sample were analyzed. Risk (A)-allele carriers showed reduced amygdala and hippocampal gray matter volumes in both cohorts with a remarkable spatial overlap. In the combined sample, genotype effects observed for the amygdala and hippocampus survived correction for entire brain volume. Further effects were also observed in the left orbitofrontal cortex and the cerebellum/fusiform gyrus. We conclude that NCAN genotype is associated with limbic gray matter alterations in healthy and depressed subjects in brain areas implicated in emotion perception and regulation.

By contrast, genetic associations with lifetime diagnoses of depression and anxiety in SA or gene-environment interactions between AVPR1B variants and stressful life events (SLEs) were not significant. An exploratory screen of interactions between AVPR1B and CRHR1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1), the principal pituitary regulator of ACTH secretion, showed no support for gene-gene interactions on the studied outcomes.

Subcortical structures including the amygdala, hippocampus, ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, and thalamus subserve reward functioning and may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related damage. These structures may also show pre-existing deficits impacting the development and maintenance of AUD. It remains unclear whether there are common genetic features underlying both subcortical volumes and AUD. In this study, structural brain images were acquired from 872 Mexican-American individuals from extended pedigrees. Subcortical volumes were obtained using FreeSurfer, and quantitative genetic analyses were performed in SOLAR. We hypothesized the following: (1) reduced subcortical volumes in individuals with lifetime AUD relative to unrelated controls; (2) reduced subcortical volumes in individuals with current relative to past AUD; (3) in non-AUD individuals, reduced subcortical volumes in those with a family history of AUD compared to those without; and (4) evidence for common genetic underpinnings (pleiotropy) between AUD risk and subcortical volumes. Results showed that individuals with lifetime AUD showed larger ventricular and smaller amygdala volumes compared to non-AUD individuals. For the amygdala, there were no differences in volume between current vs past AUD, and non-AUD individuals with a family history of AUD demonstrated reductions compared to those with no such family history. Finally, amygdala volume was genetically correlated with the risk for AUD. Together, these results suggest that reduced amygdala volume reflects a pre-existing difference rather than alcohol-induced neurotoxic damage.

Considerable variability has been observed with regard to the individual development of attention problems over time. In particular, the period of adolescence is characterized by substantial maturation of executive functioning including attentional processing, with the influence of genetic and environmental factors on individual trajectories not yet well understood. In the present investigation, we evaluated whether the monoamine oxidase A functional promoter polymorphism, MAOA-LPR, plays a role in determining continuity of parent-rated attention problems during adolescence. At the same time, a potential effect of severe life events (SLEs) was taken into account. A multi-group path analysis was used in a sample of 234 adolescents (149 males, 85 females) who took part in an epidemiological cohort study at the ages of 11 and 15 years. Attention problems during early adolescence were found to be a strong predictor of attention problems in middle adolescence. However, in carriers of the MAOA-LPR low-activity variant (MAOA-L), stability was found to be significantly higher than in carriers of the high-activity variant (MAOA-H). Additionally, only in MAOA-L carriers did SLEs during adolescence significantly impact on attention problems at the age of 15 years, implying a possible gene × environment interaction.

In psychometric research, a distinction is made between general fluid intelligence (gF) - the ability to reason in novel situations - and general crystallized intelligence (gC) - the ability to apply acquired knowledge. This distinction is supported by developmental and cognitive neuroscience studies.

Novel QTL at chromosome 6p22 for alcohol consumption: Implications for the genetic liability of alcohol use disorders.,"Kos, Mark Z; Glahn, David C; Carless, Melanie A; Olvera, Rene; McKay, D Reese; Quillen, Ellen E; Gelernter, Joel; Chen, Xiang-Ding; Deng, Hong-Wen; Kent, Jack W; Dyer, Thomas D; Göring, Harald H H; Curran, Joanne E; Duggirala, Ravi; Blangero, John; Almasy, Laura","Linkage studies of alcoholism have implicated several chromosome regions, leading to the successful identification of susceptibility genes, including ADH4 and GABRA2 on chromosome 4. Quantitative endophenotypes that are potentially closer to gene action than clinical endpoints offer a means of obtaining more refined linkage signals of genes that predispose alcohol use disorders (AUD). In this study we examine a self-reported measure of the maximum number of drinks consumed in a 24-hr period (abbreviated Max Drinks), a significantly heritable phenotype (h(2) = 0.32 ± 0.05; P = 4.61 × 10(-14)) with a strong genetic correlation with AUD (ρg = 0.99 ± 0.13) for the San Antonio Family Study (n = 1,203). Genome-wide SNPs were analyzed using variance components linkage methods in the program SOLAR, revealing a novel, genome-wide significant QTL (LOD = 4.17; P = 5.85 × 10(-6)) for Max Drinks at chromosome 6p22.3, a region with a number of compelling candidate genes implicated in neuronal function and psychiatric illness. Joint analysis of Max Drinks and AUD status shows that the QTL has a significant non-zero effect on diagnosis (P = 4.04 × 10(-3)), accounting for 8.6% of the total variation. Significant SNP associations for Max Drinks were also identified at the linkage region, including one, rs7761213 (P = 2.14 × 10(-4)), obtained for an independent sample of Chinese families.

Childhood stress exposure among preadolescents with and without family histories of substance use disorders.,"Charles, Nora E; Ryan, Stacy R; Acheson, Ashley; Mathias, Charles W; Liang, Yuanyuan; Dougherty, Donald M","Having a family history of substance use disorders (FH+) increases risk for developing a substance use disorder. This risk may be at least partially mediated by increased exposure to childhood stressors among FH+ individuals. However, measures typically used to assess exposure to stressors are narrow in scope and vary across studies. The nature of stressors that disproportionately affect FH+ children and how these stressors relate to later substance use in this population are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to assess exposure to a broad range of stressors among FH+ and FH- children to better characterize how exposure to childhood stressors relates to increased risk for substance misuse among FH+ individuals. A total of 386 children (305 FH+, 81 FH-; ages 10-12) were assessed using the Stressful Life Events Schedule before the onset of regular substance use. Both the number and severity of stressors were compared. Preliminary follow-up analyses were done for 53 adolescents who subsequently reported initiation of substance use. FH+ children reported more frequent and severe stressors than did FH- children, specifically in the areas of housing, family, school, crime, peers, and finances. Additionally, risk for substance use initiation during early adolescence was influenced directly by having a family history of substance use disorders and also indirectly through increased exposure to stressors among FH+ individuals. In conclusion, FH+ children experience greater stress across multiple domains, which contributes to their risk for substance misuse and related problems during adolescence and young adulthood.

Genetic heterogeneity and insufficient genomic coverage may account for the missing heritability. We performed a two-stage association study for ADHD in the Han Chinese population. In the discovery stage, 1033 ADHD patients and 950 healthy controls were genotyped using both the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. The genotyped SNPs were combined to generate a powerful SNP set with better genomic coverage especially for the nonsynonymous variants. In addition to the association of single SNPs, we collected adjacent SNPs as SNP sets, which were determined by either genes or successive sliding windows, to evaluate their synergetic effect. The candidate susceptibility SNPs were further replicated in an independent cohort of 1441 ADHD patients and 1447 healthy controls. No genome-wide significant SNPs or gene-based SNP sets were found to be associated with ADHD. However, two continuous sliding windows located in ITGA1 (P-value=8.33E-7 and P-value=8.43E-7) were genome-wide significant.

DOI is an important but relatively understudied factor in GD. Our objective was to investigate clinical and neurocognitive characteristics associated with different DOI. Methods This study evaluated 448 adults diagnosed with GD. All assessments were completed prior to treatments being commenced. Results Our main results were: (a) there is a negative correlation between DOI and lag between first gambling and onset of GD; (b) lifetime history of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with a longer duration of GD; (c) the presence of a first-degree relative with history of AUD is associated with a more extended course of GD; and (d) there is a negative correlation between DOI and quality of life. Discussion This study suggests that some important variables are associated with different DOI. Increasing treatment-seeking behavior, providing customized psychological interventions, and effectively managing AUD may decrease the high levels of chronicity in GD. Furthermore, research on GD such as phenomenological studies and clinical trials may consider the duration of GD in their methodology.

Converging evidence across species suggests that links between childhood stress and amygdala function may be dependent upon hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Using data from college-attending non-Hispanic European-Americans (n=308) who completed the Duke Neurogenetics Study, we examined whether early life stress (ELS) and HPA axis genetic variation interact to predict threat-related amygdala function as well as psychopathology symptoms. A biologically-informed multilocus profile score (BIMPS) captured HPA axis genetic variation (FKBP5 rs1360780, CRHR1 rs110402; NR3C2 rs5522/rs4635799) previously associated with its function (higher BIMPS are reflective of higher HPA axis activity). BOLD fMRI data were acquired while participants completed an emotional face matching task. ELS and depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the childhood trauma questionnaire and the mood and anxiety symptom questionnaire, respectively. The interaction between HPA axis BIMPS and ELS was associated with right amygdala reactivity to threat-related stimuli, after accounting for multiple testing (empirical-p=0.016). Among individuals with higher BIMPS (i.e., the upper 21.4%), ELS was positively coupled with threat-related amygdala reactivity, which was absent among those with average or low BIMPS. Further, higher BIMPS were associated with greater self-reported anxious arousal, though there was no evidence that amygdala function mediated this relationship. Polygenic variation linked to HPA axis function may moderate the effects of early life stress on threat-related amygdala function and confer risk for anxiety symptomatology. However, what, if any, neural mechanisms may mediate the relationship between HPA axis BIMPS and anxiety symptomatology remains unclear.",2017,Jun,Psychoneuroendocrinology,80,,170-178,28364727,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.03.016,28364727,#1078,DiIorio 2017,"",""

The current prospective study aimed to clarify how and under what circumstances variations in 5-HTTLPR transmit risk for various alcohol-related outcomes. Participants were 218 adolescents and young adults (29% female) enrolled in the Michigan Longitudinal Study. We tested a moderated mediation model with 5-HTTLPR as the predictor, Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol (SRE) score as the mediator, alcohol-related outcomes as the dependent variables, parental monitoring as the moderator of the SRE to alcohol outcomes path, and prior drinks, sex, age, and body mass index as covariates. Four alcohol-related outcomes were tested. The S allele was associated with higher SRE scores (i.e., lower response to alcohol). Parental monitoring was a significant moderator: At low levels of parental monitoring, higher SRE scores predicted more drinks consumed and binge drinking episodes. At high levels of monitoring, higher SRE scores were significantly related to fewer alcohol-related problems. Findings suggest that one mechanism by which 5-HTTLPR variation transmits alcohol-related risk is through level of response to alcohol.

Cannabis and a lower BMI in psychosis: What is the role of AKT1?,"Liemburg, Edith J; Bruins, Jojanneke; van Beveren, Nico; Islam, Md Atiqul; Alizadeh, Behrooz Z; GROUP investigators","Cannabis use has been associated with favorable outcomes on metabolic risk factors. The cause of this relation is still unknown. In this study we investigated whether this effect is mediated by the AKT1 gene, as activation of the related enzyme by cannabis may cause metabolic changes. Six Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AKT1 gene (rs1130214, rs1130233, rs2494732, rs2498784, rs3730358, and rs3803300) of patients with psychotic disorders (n=623) were related to Body Mass Index (BMI), levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c) and total metabolic risk. Next, mediation analysis was performed with BMI as outcome, cannabis as predictor, and AKT1 as mediator. Cannabis use was inversely related to BMI but not with levels of HBA1c and total metabolic risk. Moreover, out of 6 AKT1 SNPs, rs2494732 was associated with cannabis use, but AKT1 did not mediate the effect of cannabis on BMI. In conclusion, cannabis use is likely to be associated with a lower BMI in patients with a psychotic disorder.

There is increasing evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies that the MR has different effects on behavior and mood in males and females. To investigate the hypothesis that the MR sex-dependently influences the relation between childhood maltreatment and depression, we investigated three common and functional MR haplotypes (GA, CA, and CG haplotype, based on rs5522 and rs2070951) in a population-based cohort (N = 665) and an independent clinical cohort from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (N = 1639). The CA haplotype sex-dependently moderated the relation between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms both in the population-based sample (sex × maltreatment × haplotype: β = -4.07, P = 0.029) and in the clinical sample (sex × maltreatment × haplotype, β = -2.40, P = 0.011). Specifically, female individuals in the population-based sample were protected (β = -4.58, P = 2.0 e(-5)), whereas males in the clinical sample were at increased risk (β = 2.54, P = 0.0022). In line with these results, female GA haplotype carriers displayed increased vulnerability in the population-based sample (β = 4.58, P = 7.5 e(-5)) whereas male CG-carriers showed increased resilience in the clinical sample (β = -2.71, P = 0.016). Consistently, we found a decreased lifetime MDD risk for male GA haplotype carriers following childhood maltreatment but an increased risk for male CA haplotype carriers in the clinical sample. In both samples, sex-dependent effects were observed for GA-GA diplotype carriers. In summary, sex plays an important role in determining whether functional genetic variation in MR is beneficial or detrimental, with an apparent female advantage for the CA haplotype but male advantage for the GA and CG haplotype. These sex-dependent effects of MR on depression susceptibility following childhood maltreatment are relevant in light of the increased prevalence of mood disorders in women and point to a sex-specific role of MR in the etiology of depression following childhood maltreatment.",2015,Apr,Psychoneuroendocrinology,54,,90-102,25686805,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.018,25686805,#1147,Vinkers 2015,"",""

Applying an imaging genetics approach in two cohorts (N=487; N=478) of healthy non-smoking adolescents, we aimed to elucidate the impact of genome-wide significant smoking-associated variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster on reward-related neural responses in central regions such as the striatum, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and personality traits related to addiction. In both samples, carriers of the rs578776 GG compared with AG/AA genotype showed a significantly lower neural response to reward outcomes in the right ventral and dorsal ACC but not the striatum or the orbitofrontal cortex. Rs578776 was unrelated to neural reward anticipation or reward magnitude. Significantly higher scores of anxiety sensitivity in GG compared with AG/AA carriers were found only in sample 1.

The present study addressed these issues by examining the concurrent and prospective longitudinal effects of maternal parenting, DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism, and their interaction on adolescent depressive symptoms in a sample of 1026 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 11.33 ± 0.47 years at T1, 50.3% girls) in a three-wave longitudinal study from age 11 to 13. Results indicated that maternal positive and negative parenting significantly concurrently predicted adolescent depressive symptoms at all three waves, whereas TaqIA polymorphism had no main effect on depressive symptoms. TaqIA polymorphism interacted with negative parenting in predicting concurrent depressive symptoms at age 11 and 12. A1 carriers were more susceptible to negative parenting compared to A2A2 homozygotes, such that adolescents carrying A1 alleles experiencing high negative parenting reported more depressive symptoms but fared better when experiencing low negative parenting. However, the interaction became nonsignificant at age 13, indicating the interaction of TaqIA polymorphism and maternal parenting may vary with development.

Moreover, in line with a suppression process of GxE, victimization by other peers reduced the role of genetic factors in explaining interindividual differences in anxiety. In contrast, in line with a diathesis-stress process of GxE, victimization by a close friend fostered the expression of a genetic disposition for anxiety.

Meanwhile, ADHD has been suggested as the extreme end of a continuously distributed trait that can be found in the general population. Therefore, we examined two possibilities: (1) an ADHD-related continuous trait may be associated with the CLOCK gene, and (2) this association may be mediated by the degree of individuals' evening preference. To explore these possibilities, we performed a quantitative trait locus association study with a sample of 1,289 healthy adults.

After controlling for the CSM total score as a covariate, the strength of the association did not change at all, suggesting that the association was not mediated by evening preference.

Reports have argued that an abnormal HPA axis response can be due to an altered P-Glycoprotein (P-GP) function. This argument suggests that genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 may have an effect on the HPA axis activity; however, it is still not clear if this influences the risk of MDD. Our study aims to evaluate the effect of ABCB1 C1236T, G2677TA and C3435T genetic polymorphisms on MDD risk in a subset of Portuguese patients.

Behavioral functioning in cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome: Risk factors and impact on parenting experience.,"Pierpont, Elizabeth I; Wolford, Melinda","The present study is an investigation of behavioral functioning in children with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC). CFC is a rare single-gene disorder associated with cardiac disease, characteristic skin and facial features, intellectual disability, and neurological complications such as seizures and structural brain anomalies. Emotional and behavioral features of CFC have not been systematically investigated. We aimed to identify key variables that contribute to psychopathology during childhood and adolescence, and to examine the impact of challenging behaviors on the caregiving experience. Parents of 34 children and adolescents with CFC completed standardized broadband measures of child emotional and behavioral functioning, as well as measures of sensory modulation, functional communication, and caregiver stress. Results indicate that children with CFC syndrome are at heightened risk for psychopathology, with attention problems, social difficulties, and unusual behaviors (e.g., obsessive thoughts, strange behaviors, repetitive acts) found to be especially prevalent. Behavioral challenges in children with CFC syndrome were significantly associated with a history of obstetric complications and with problems modulating sensory information. With regard to the impact of child neurocognitive and behavioral issues on the caregiving experience, parent self-reported stress was significantly higher among parents of children who engaged in more problem behaviors, and lower among parents whose children could communicate effectively with others. Results of this study suggest avenues to help families cope with CFC-related stressors and enhance overall functioning. In particular, this study highlights the need for educational and treatment interventions aimed at addressing sensory needs, increasing functional communication, and identifying and managing challenging behaviors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016,Aug,American journal of medical genetics.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the REG-CTNNA2 region of chromosome 2 and NEIL3 associated with impulsivity in a Native American sample.,"Ehlers, C L; Gizer, I R; Bizon, C; Slutske, W; Peng, Q; Schork, N J; Wilhelmsen, K C","Impulsivity is a multi-faceted construct that, while characterized by a set of correlated dimensions, is centered around a core definition that involves acting suddenly in an unplanned manner without consideration for the consequences of such behavior. Several psychiatric disorders include impulsivity as a criterion, and thus it has been suggested that it may link a number of different behavioral disorders, including substance abuse. Native Americans (NA) experience some of the highest rates of substance abuse of all the US ethnic groups. The described analyses used data from a low-coverage whole genome sequence scan to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an impulsivity phenotype in an American Indian community sample (n = 658). Demographic and clinical information were obtained using a semi-structured interview. Impulsivity was assessed using a scale derived from the Maudsley personality inventory that combines both novelty seeking and lack of planning items. The impulsivity score was tested for association with each variant adjusted for demographic variables, and corrected for ancestry and kinship, using emmax. Simulations were conducted to calculate empirical P-values. Genome-wide significant findings were observed for a variant 50-kb upstream from catenin cadherin-associated protein, alpha 2 (CTNNA2), a neuronal-specific catenin, in the REG gene cluster. A meta-analysis of GWAS had previously identified common variants in CTNNA2 as being associated with excitement seeking.

IL-18 is expressed in brain and is increased in patients with moderate to severe depression. In this study we aim to evaluate the role of IL18-607C&amp;gt;A and IL18-137G&amp;gt;C promoter polymorphisms in antidepressant treatment phenotypes, specifically relapse and treatment resistant depression (TRD). We genotyped the referred polymorphisms in a subset of 80 MDD patients followed at Hospital Magalhães Lemos, Portugal, within a period of 27 months. Patients carrying IL18-607 CA or AA genotypes were significantly more prone to relapse after AD treatment and present a significantly lower time to relapse than patients carrying CC genotype. Similarly, patients carrying IL18-137 GC or CC genotypes have a significantly higher risk of relapse and display relapse significantly earlier than the ones carrying GG genotype. Due to the low number of IL18-607 CC and IL18-137 GG in the relapse subgroup (n=3 and n=5, respectively), results were validated by bootstrapping analysis, and remained significant. No association was found between the evaluated genetic polymorphisms and TRD. IL18 peripheral mRNA levels were upregulated in IL18-607 CA or AA carriers. This preliminary report indicates that IL18-607C&amp;gt;A and IL18-137G&amp;gt;C genetic polymorphisms seem to influence depression relapse after antidepressant treatment in our subset of depressed patients, and may possibly contribute to the disregulated IL-18 levels found in patients with depression.",,,Neuroscience letters,622,,107-112,27001087,10.1016/j.neulet.2016.03.026,27001087,#1216,,"",""

To examine the relationship more comprehensively, various factors of pain processing having putative associations with 5-HT functioning were studied, namely the subjective pain experience (pain threshold, rating of experimental pain), catastrophizing about pain (Pain Catastrophizing Scale = PCS) and motor responsiveness (facial expression of pain). In 60 female and 67 male participants, heat pain stimuli were applied by a contact thermode to assess pain thresholds, supra-threshold ratings and a composite score of pain-relevant facial responses. Participants also completed the PCS and were grouped based on their 5-HTTLPR genotype (bi-allelic evaluation) into a group with s-allele carriers (ss, sl) and a second group without (ll). S-allele carriers proved to have lower pain thresholds and higher PCS scores. These two positive findings were unrelated to each other. No other difference between genotype groups became significant. In all analyses, ""age"" and ""gender"" were controlled for. In s-allele carriers the subjective pain experience and the tendency to catastrophize about pain was enhanced, suggesting that the s-allele might be a risk factor for the development and maintenance of pain.

Changing relationships between smoking and psychiatric disorders across twentieth century birth cohorts: clinical and research implications.,"Talati, A; Keyes, K M; Hasin, D S","As the risks of tobacco use become recognized and smoking becomes stigmatized, new smokers may be increasingly driven to smoke by biological or genetic vulnerabilities rather than social desirability. Given that genetic risk for deviant proneness is shared across other psychiatric and addictive disorders, we predicted that as rates of smoking decreased through the latter half of the twentieth century, associations between smoking and psychopathology would increase. Participants (N=25 412) from a large US study-the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, NESARC-were interviewed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule - DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV) and classified into one of five birth cohort decades (1940s to 1980s) and three smoking history (nonsmokers, never-dependent smokers and ever-dependent smokers) groups. We found that the prevalence of smoking decreased across the five birth cohorts, but associations of smoking with drug and AUDs, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and antisocial personality disorder, each increased monotonically in more recently born cohorts, even after adjusting for concurrent demographic and socioeconomic changes. For drug and AUDs, increases were observed among smokers both with and without a history of nicotine dependence; for other outcomes, increases were entirely driven by nicotine-dependent smokers. Findings suggest that smokers in more recent cohorts have disproportionately high psychiatric vulnerability, and may benefit from greater mental health screenings. Differentiating between casual and dependent smokers may further help prioritize those at greatest risk. Researchers should also be aware of potential variation in psychiatric comorbidity based on cohort of birth when defining groups of smokers, to minimize confounding.",2016,Apr,Molecular psychiatry,21,4,464-471,26809837,10.1038/mp.2015.224,26809837,#1223,Talati 2016,"",""

The role of familial risk for addiction and an associated endophenotype, P300 amplitude, has not previously been related to cannabis use and dependence. A prospective longitudinal study spanning childhood and young adulthood provided the opportunity for exploring these factors, along with genetic variation, in the cannabis use behaviors of 338 young adult offspring from high and low familial risk for alcohol dependence families (ages 19-30). P300 data were collected multiple times in childhood. The association between young adult patterns of cannabis use or cannabis abuse/dependence was tested with genetic variation in the cannabinoid gene, CNR1, the ANKK1-DRD2 gene, and childhood developmental trajectories of P300. Young adult patterns of cannabis use was characterized by three patterns: (i) no use throughout; (ii) declining use from adolescence through young adulthood; and (iii) frequent use throughout.

Topological and functional analyses of genes in this network uncovered genes related to synapse, cell adhesion, glutamatergic and serotoninergic pathways, both confirming findings of previous studies and capturing new genes and genetic variants in these pathways.",,,Scientific reports,6,,22851,26947246,10.1038/srep22851,26947246,#1230,,"",""
"The functional serotonin 1a receptor promoter polymorphism, rs6295, is associated with psychiatric illness and differences in transcription.","Donaldson, Z R; le Francois, B; Santos, T L; Almli, L M; Boldrini, M; Champagne, F A; Arango, V; Mann, J J; Stockmeier, C A; Galfalvy, H; Albert, P R; Ressler, K J; Hen, R","The G/C single-nucleotide polymorphism in the serotonin 1a receptor promoter, rs6295, has previously been linked with depression, suicide and antidepressant responsiveness. In vitro studies suggest that rs6295 may have functional effects on the expression of the serotonin 1a receptor gene (HTR1A) through altered binding of a number of transcription factors. To further explore the relationship between rs6295, mental illness and gene expression, we performed dual epidemiological and biological studies. First, we genotyped a cohort of 1412 individuals, randomly split into discovery and replication cohorts, to examine the relationship between rs6295 and five psychiatric outcomes: history of psychiatric hospitalization, history of suicide attempts, history of substance or alcohol abuse, current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), current depression. We found that the rs6295G allele is associated with increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric hospitalization and suicide attempts. Overall, exposure to either childhood or non-childhood trauma resulted in increased risk for all psychiatric outcomes, but we did not observe a significant interaction between rs6295 and trauma in modulating psychiatric outcomes. In conjunction, we also investigated the potential impact of rs6295 on HTR1A expression in postmortem human brain tissue using relative allelic expression assays. We found more mRNA produced from the C versus the G-allele of rs6295 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but not in the midbrain of nonpsychiatric control subjects. Further, in the fetal cortex, rs6295C allele exhibited increased relative expression as early as gestational week 18 in humans. Finally, we found that the C:G allelic expression ratio was significantly neutralized in the PFC of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) who committed suicide as compared with controls, indicating that normal patterns of transcription may be disrupted in MDD/suicide. These data provide a putative biological mechanism underlying the association between rs6295, trauma and mental illness. Moreover, our results suggest that rs6295 may affect transcription during both gestational development and adulthood in a region-specific manner, acting as a risk factor for psychiatric illness. These findings provide a critical framework for conceptualizing the effects of a common functional genetic variant, trauma exposure and their impact on mental health.",,,Translational psychiatry,6,,e746,26926882,10.1038/tp.2015.226,26926882,#1231,,"",""

We investigated non-specific risk for ""general"" substance dependence, comparing cases dependent on any substance to controls who were non-dependent on all assessed substances. We also examined five specific substance dependence diagnoses: DSM-IV alcohol, opioid, cannabis, and cocaine dependence, and nicotine dependence defined by the proxy of heavy/light smoking (cigarettes-per-day &amp;gt;20 vs. ≤ 10). The G allele showed a modest protective effect on general substance dependence (OR = 0.90, 95% C.I. [0.83-0.97], p value = 0.0095, N = 16,908).

GABA synthesis is controlled by two glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) genes, GAD1 and GAD2, both of which produce a number of alternative transcripts. Genetic variants in the GAD1 gene are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, and reduced expression of its major transcript in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). No consistent changes in GAD2 expression have been found in brains from patients with schizophrenia. In this work, with the use of RNA sequencing and PCR technologies, we confirmed and tracked the expression of an alternative truncated transcript of GAD2 (ENST00000428517) in human control DLPFC homogenates across lifespan besides the well-known full length transcript of GAD2. In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR, expression of GAD2 full length and truncated transcripts were measured in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The expression of GAD2 full length transcript is decreased in the DLPFC of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, while GAD2 truncated transcript is increased in bipolar disorder patients but decreased in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the patients with schizophrenia with completed suicide or positive nicotine exposure showed significantly higher expression of GAD2 full length transcript. Alternative transcripts of GAD2 may be important in the growth and development of GABA-synthesizing neurons as well as abnormal GABA signaling in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders.",,,PloS one,11,2,e0148558,26848839,10.1371/journal.pone.0148558,26848839,#1233,,"",""

To investigate whether this effect is likely to be causal, we used a Mendelian randomization design with a functional gene variant. In a case-control study, we examined the association between ADHD symptoms in children and blood lead level as moderated by variants in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene.

The genetics and neurobiology of ESSENCE: The third Birgit Olsson lecture.,"Bourgeron, Thomas","ESSENCE refers to early symptomatic syndromes eliciting neurodevelopmental clinical examinations.

ESSENCE includes among others attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Some degree of disability is the rule rather than the exception. The causes are heterogeneous ranging from extreme social deprivation, pre- and perinatal risk factors, genetic and metabolic diseases, immune and infectious disorders, nutritional factors, physical trauma, and postnatal toxic and environmental factors (and combinations/interactions of some or several of these). Treatments often involve a combination of psychoeducational interventions, home- and school-based programmes, and medication. Here, I will first briefly review our main knowledge on the biological pathways associated with early onset neurodevelopmental disorders and will provide useful links to be informed of the progress in the field. Five main pathways are associated with ASD and ID: chromatin remodelling, cytoskeleton dynamics, mRNA translation, metabolism and synapse formation/function. I will then detail three propositions coming from institutions, researchers and/or communities of patients and families to foster research: 1) to use more dimensional and quantitative data than diagnostic categories; 2) to increase data sharing and research on genetic and brain diversity in human populations; 3) to involve patients and relatives as participants for research.

Diminished error-related brain activity as a promising endophenotype for substance-use disorders: evidence from high-risk offspring.,"Euser, Anja S; Evans, Brittany E; Greaves-Lord, Kirstin; Huizink, Anja C; Franken, Ingmar H A","One of the core features of individuals with a substance-use disorder (SUD) is the reduced ability to successfully process errors and monitor performance, as reflected by diminished error-related negativities (ERN). However, whether these error-related brain abnormalities are caused by chronic substance use or rather predates it remains unclear. The present study elucidated whether hypoactive performance monitoring represents an endophenotypic vulnerability marker for SUD by using a high-risk paradigm. We assessed the behavioral components of error-processing, as well as the amplitude of the ERN in the event-related brain potential (ERP) during performance of the Eriksen Flanker Task among high-risk adolescents of parents with a SUD (HR; n = 28) and normal-risk controls (NR; n = 40). Results revealed that HR offspring were characterized by a higher prevalence of internalizing symptoms and more frequent cannabis use, the latter having a significant influence on the ERN.

The Copine V (CPNE5) gene is involved in Ca(2+) binding and may play an important role in the development of the central nervous system. This study tested the genetic associations of 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CPNE5 gene with alcohol dependence (AD) and obesity using a Caucasian sample - The Study of Addiction - Genetics and Environment (SAGE) sample (1066 AD cases and 1278 non-AD controls, 422 obese cases and 1395 non-obese controls). The Marshfield sample (1442 obese cases and 2122 non-obese controls) was used for replication of obesity. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the PLINK software.

Thus, rather than seeking to replicate this specific GXE interaction in another sample of adolescents or adults, these investigators shifted the developmental focus-to very young children, aged 3-5 years of age. This re-direction was motivated by the kindling hypothesis which stipulates that the earliest episodes of depression might be especially sensitive to environmental adversity, with later episodes very much dependent on earlier ones and less a function of later-life environmental provocation.

Denser SNPs are now available with the completion of the 1000 Genomes and the Genome of the Netherlands projects. More densely distributed SNPs are expected to track the causal variants better. Therefore we extend the search for variants implicated in early stages of cannabis use to previously untagged common and low-frequency variants. We run heritability, SNP and gene-based analyses of initiation and age at onset. This is the first genome-wide study of age at onset to date. Using GCTA and a sample of distantly related individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, we estimated that the currently measured (and tagged) SNPs collectively explain 25 % of the variance in initiation (SE = 0.088; P = 0.0016). Chromosomes 4 and 18, previously linked with cannabis use and other addiction phenotypes, account for the largest amount of variance in initiation (6.8 %, SE = 0.025, P = 0.002 and 3.6 %, SE = 0.01, P = 0.012, respectively). No individual SNP- or gene-based test reached genomewide significance in the initiation or age at onset analyses. Our study detected association signal in the currently measured SNPs. A comparison with prior SNP-heritability estimates suggests that at least part of the signal is likely coming from previously untyped common and low frequency variants. Our results do not rule out the contribution of rare variants of larger effect-a plausible source of the difference between the twin-based heritability estimate and that from GCTA.

Recent studies associated structural variations of the GSK3B gene to bipolar disorder (BP), although replications were not conclusive. Here we present data on copy number variations (CNVs) of the GSK3B gene probing the 9th exon region in 846 individuals (414 controls, 172 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 260 with BP). A significant accumulation (odds ratio: 5.5, P = 0.00051) of the amplified exon 9 region was found in patients (22 out of 432) compared to controls (4 of 414).

A more detailed analysis of the identified GSK3B CNV by a set of probes covering the GSK3B gene and the adjacent NR1I2 and C3orf15 genes showed that the amplified sequences contained 3' (downstream) segments of the GSK3B and NR1I2 genes but none of them involved the C3orf15 gene. Therefore, the copy number variation of the GSK3B gene could be described as a complex set of structural variants involving partial duplications and deletions, simultaneously.

GRM3 polymorphisms were reported to be associated with prefrontal activity, cognitive shifting, and memory capability in healthy subjects, as well as susceptibility to schizophrenia and depression. The goal of this study was to replicate the association of GRM3 with schizophrenia and depression and to explore GRM3's potential association with heroin dependence (HD) in a Chinese population. Seventeen SNPs throughout the GRM3 gene were genotyped using MALDI-TOF within the MassARRAY system, and the allele and genotype distributions were compared between 619 healthy controls and 433 patients with schizophrenia, 409 patients with major depression, and 584 unrelated addicts. We found that GRM3 polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to HD but do not significantly influence the risk for schizophrenia or depression. An increased risk of HD was significantly associated with the minor alleles of two GRM3 SNPs, including the T allele of rs274618 (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.631, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.317-2.005), the T allele of rs274622 (OR = 1.652, 95% CI: 1.336-2.036), compared with the major alleles.

As endocannabinoid signaling and dopamine neurotransmission have been shown to be involved in drug reward, genes related to these systems are plausible candidates for susceptibility to CD. The cannabinoid receptor 1 protein regulates both the endocannabinoid and dopaminergic neurobiological systems, and polymorphisms in the cannabinoid receptor gene, CNR1, have been associated previously with substance dependence. In this study, we attempt to replicate findings associating CNR1 with CD in African Americans.

However, because there is considerable co-morbidity of CD with other drugs of abuse, additional studies are necessary to determine whether polymorphisms in CNR1 induce a general susceptibility to substance dependence or are specific to cocaine addiction.

Animal models and human studies suggest that this effect is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In humans, epigenetic studies to investigate the influence of ELS on psychiatric phenotypes are limited by the inaccessibility of living brain tissue. Due to the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic signatures, it is impossible to determine whether ELS induced epigenetic changes in accessible peripheral cells, for example, blood lymphocytes, reflect epigenetic changes in the brain. To overcome these limitations, we applied a cross-species approach involving: (i) the analysis of CD34+ cells from human cord blood; (ii) the examination of blood-derived CD3+ T cells of newborn and adolescent nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta); and (iii) the investigation of the prefrontal cortex of adult rats. Several regions in MORC1 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 1; previously known as: microrchidia (mouse) homolog) were differentially methylated in response to ELS in CD34+ cells and CD3+ T cells derived from the blood of human and monkey neonates, as well as in CD3+ T cells derived from the blood of adolescent monkeys and in the prefrontal cortex of adult rats. MORC1 is thus the first identified epigenetic marker of ELS to be present in blood cell progenitors at birth and in the brain in adulthood.

However, the interaction between them can be viewed through two conflicting frameworks. Under a mismatch hypothesis stressful childhoods allow 'adaptive programming' for a stressful adulthood and so can be protective. Only when childhood and adulthood do not match is there a risk of behavioural problems. Alternatively, under the cumulative stress hypothesis we expect increased risk with each additional stressor. It has also been suggested that an individual's genetic background may determine the extent they undergo adaptive programming, and so which of these two hypotheses is relevant. In this study we test for an interaction between exposure to childhood maltreatment and adult stressful life events in a retrospective sample of 455 individuals, using major depression as the outcome. We also test whether this interaction differs by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR, a candidate for an individual's plasticity to adaptive programming. Early maltreatment and stressful life events in adulthood interacted to produce increased risk for depression over each individually (p = 0.055). This supports the cumulative stress hypothesis over the mismatch hypothesis, at least with respect to severe environmental risk factors. This effect was not altered by 5-HTTLPR allele, suggesting there was no difference by genotype in adaptive programming to these events.

The study now includes three generations and five completed assessment waves spanning 25 years, with a sixth wave underway. Beginning with the fourth wave, we collected measures of brain structure (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and physiology (electroencephalography, EEG) and DNA in order to examine at a biological level why the offspring of depressed parents were at higher risk. In this paper, we provide an overview of the study design, the main findings, including new data, and the role of the high-risk design in translational research. We demonstrate that offspring of depressed parents ('high-risk'), when compared with those of non-depressed parents ('low-risk'), were at increased risk for depressive and anxiety disorders, with anxiety appearing earlier and being a predisposing factor for MDD. Offspring with two generations previously affected were at greatest risk. Thinning of the cortical mantle (MRI) and reduced resting-state activity (EEG) within the right parieto-temporal hemisphere differentiated high- from low-risk offspring, regardless of whether the offspring had MDD, suggesting that these measures might serve as familial trait markers for depression and related syndromes. The high- and low-risk offspring also differed by serotonin transporter promoter length polymorphism genotypes, even though the same genotypes were not associated with the presence of MDD.

Disruptions of biological rhythms increase risk of mood disorders. Because clinical representation of disease is heterogeneous, homogenous sets of patients are suggested to use in the association analyses. In our study, we aimed to apply previously computed structure of bipolar disorder symptom dimension for analyses of genetic association. We based quantitative trait on: main depression, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances, excitement and psychotic dimensions consisted of OPCRIT checklist items. We genotyped 42 polymorphisms from circadian clock genes: PER3, ARNTL, CLOCK and TIMELSSS from 511 patients BD (n = 292 women and n = 219 men).

Paradoxically, serotonin transporter blockade relieves depression symptoms. Rodent models suggest that decreased serotonin transporter in early life produces depression that emerges in adolescence, whereas decreased serotonin transporter that occurs later in development ameliorates depression. However, no brain imaging research has yet investigated the moderating influence of human development on the link between 5-HTTLPR and effect-related brain function. We investigated the age-related effect of 5-HTTLPR on amygdala activation and amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity using a well-replicated probe, an emotional face task, in children and adolescents aged 9-19 years.

However, peer association does not affect all adolescents in the same way. To better understand when and under what conditions peer association is most linked with adolescent substance use (SU), this review focuses on the factors that may operate as moderators of this association. The review highlighted several potential moderators reflecting adolescents' individual characteristics (e.g., pubertal status, genes and personality), peer and parental factors (e.g., nature of relationships and parental monitoring), and contextual factors (e.g., peer, school and neighborhood context). As peer association is a broad concept, important methodological aspects were also addressed in order to illustrate how they can potentially bias interpretation. Taking these into account, we suggest that, while the effects of some moderators are clear (e.g., parental monitoring and sensation seeking), others are less straightforward (e.g., neighborhood) and need to be further examined. This review also provides recommendations for addressing different methodological concerns in the study of moderators, including: the use of longitudinal and experimental studies and the use of mediated moderation.

The significance of at-risk or prodromal symptoms for bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents.,"Hauser, Marta; Correll, Christoph U","While in the early identification and intervention of psychosis-specific instruments and risk criteria have been generated and validated, research into indicated preventive strategies for bipolar I disorder (BD I) has only recently gained momentum. As the first signs of BD I often start before adulthood, such efforts are especially important in the vulnerable pediatric population. Data are summarized regarding the presence and nature of potentially prodromal, that is, subsyndromal, symptoms prior to BD I, defined by first-episode mania, focusing on pediatric patients. Research indicates the possibility of early identification of youth at clinical high risk for BD. Support for this proposition comes from retrospective studies of BD I patients, as well as prospective studies of community samples, offspring of BD I subjects, youth with depressive disorders, and patients at high risk for psychosis or with bipolar spectrum disorders without lifetime history of mania. These data provide essential insight into potential signs and symptoms that may enable presyndromal identification of BD I in youth. However, except for offspring studies, broader prospective approaches that focus on youth at clinical high risk for BD I and on developing specific interviews and (or) rating scales and risk criteria are mostly missing, or in their early stage. More work is needed to determine valid and sufficiently specific clinical high-risk criteria, to distinguish risk factors, endophenotypes, and comorbidities from prodromal symptomatology, and to develop phase-specific interventions that titrate the risk of intervention to the risk of transition to mania and to functional impairment or distress.

Brain structural and functional changes in adolescents with psychiatric disorders.,"Miguel-Hidalgo, José Javier","During adolescence, hormonal and neurodevelopmental changes geared to ensuring reproduction and achieving independence are very likely mediated by the growth of neural processes, remodeling of synaptic connections, increased myelination in prefrontal areas and maturation of connecting subcortical areas. These processes, greatly accelerated in adolescence, follow an asynchronous pattern in different brain areas. Neuroimaging research using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging has produced most of the insights regarding brain structural and functional neuropathology in adolescent psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, first episodes during adolescence are linked to greater-than-normal losses in gray matter density and white matter integrity and show a divergence of maturational trajectories from normative neural development in a progression similar to that of adult-onset schizophrenia. Anxiety and mood disorders in adolescence have been linked to abnormally increased activity in the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortical areas, although some data suggest that neural abnormalities in the amygdala and anxiety maybe particularly more frequent in adolescents than in adults. Alcohol misuse in adolescence results in reduced integrity in the white matter and reduced gray matter density that, given the high intensity of adolescent synaptic and myelin remodeling, may result in persistent and profound changes in circuits supporting memory and emotional and appetitive control. The interaction of persistent changes due to prenatal exposure with the contemporaneous expression of genetic factors and disturbing environmental exposure may be an important factor in the appearance of psychiatric disorders in adolescence.

Previous research covering various tissues such as the brain, suggests that the detrimental impact of early-life stress (ELS) on mental health is mediated via epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation. Genes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis--in particular, the glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene--stand out as key targets for ELS. Even though the link between hGR methylation and either ELS or psychopathology is fairly well established, the mutually dependent relationships between ELS, DNA methylation and psychopathology remain to be uncovered. The specific psychopathology an individual might develop in the aftermath of stressful events can be highly variable, however, most studies investigating hGR methylation and psychopathology suffer from being limited to a single symptom cluster of mental disorders. Here, we screened volunteers for childhood maltreatment and analyzed whether it associates with hGR methylation in lymphocytes and a range of measures of psychological ill-health. hGR methylation in lymphocytes most likely reflects methylation patterns found in the brain and thus provides valuable insights into the etiology of psychopathology. We find the interaction between childhood maltreatment and hGR methylation to be strongly correlated with an increased vulnerability to psychopathology providing evidence of epigenome × environment interactions. Furthermore, our results indicate an additive effect of childhood maltreatment and hGR methylation in predicting borderline personality disorder (BPD)-associated symptoms, suggesting that the combination of both ELS and DNA methylation that possibly represents unfavorable events experienced even earlier in life poses the risk for BPD.",,,Translational psychiatry,5,,e571,26080088,10.1038/tp.2015.63,26080088,#1359,,"",""

We sought to establish whether altered miRNA expression might play a causative role in the development of BD by studying young, unmedicated relatives of individuals with BD, who are at a higher genetic risk of developing BD themselves (high-risk individuals). The expression of 20 miRNAs previously implicated in either BD or schizophrenia was measured by qRT-PCR in whole-blood samples from 34 high-risk and 46 control individuals. Three miRNAs, miR-15b, miR-132 and miR-652 were up-regulated in the high-risk individuals, consistent with previous reports of increased expression of these miRNAs in patients with schizophrenia.

Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Catechol-O-Methyltransferase and Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase Genes in the Pakistani Schizophrenic Population: A Study with Special Emphasis on Cannabis and Smokeless Tobacco.,"Nawaz, Rukhsana; Siddiqui, Sonia","Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex lead to impaired synthesis of dopamine. It is associated with hallucination, psychosis and hearing impairments. Many susceptible genes have been identified in schizophrenia such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and serine/threonine kinase (AKT1). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes have not been identified in Pakistan. Therefore, we investigated the allelic and genotypic frequencies in COMT and AKT1 genes in the Pakistani population. Polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing were used to identify SNPs in the genes. The present study shows that COMT Val and COMT Met allelic frequencies for the controls were p=0.52, q=0.48 and for the schizophrenic cases they were p=0.34, q=0.66 respectively. The distribution of polymorphism in COMT Val158Met genotype by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was P=0.61 for controls and P=0.005 for cases. The data reveal that SNP rs1130214 T allele mutation was found neither in patients nor in controls in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). This proves that no association of AKT1 and positive association of COMT with schizophrenia exist in the population of Pakistan. Moreover, a study based on a single family showed COMT Met allele inheritance in schizophrenic offspring. This suggested that COMT allele alteration influences susceptibility to at least some forms of psychosis in the Pakistani population. Interestingly, according to our socio-economical survey, COMT genotype has no association with cannabis but it is strongly associated with tobacco.

To better understand the association of dopamine receptors with SCZ, we studied the expression of three DRD2 splice variants and the DRD1 transcript in DLPFC, hippocampus and caudate nucleus in a large cohort of subjects (~700), including patients with SCZ, affective disorders and nonpsychiatric controls (from 14th gestational week to 85 years of age), and examined genotype-expression associations of 278 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in or near DRD2 and DRD1 genes.

The current study examined the effects of val66met, 5-HTTLPR, and family environment quality on youth depressive symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood in a longitudinal sample oversampled for maternal depression history. A differential susceptibility model was tested, comparing the effects of family environment on depression scores across different levels of a cumulative plasticity genotype, defined as presence of both, either, or neither plasticity alleles (defined here as val66met Met and 5-HTTLPR 'S'). Cumulative plasticity genotype interacted with family environment quality to predict depression among males and females at age 15. After age 15, however, the interaction of cumulative plasticity genotype and early family environment quality was only predictive of depression among females. Results supported a differential susceptibility model at age 15, such that plasticity allele presence was associated with more or less depressive symptoms depending on valence of the family environment, and a diathesis-stress model of gene-environment interaction after age 15.

Participants were also genotyped for the A118G polymorphism in the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, rs1799971), which has been found to influence neural and psychological responses to rejection, likely by affecting opioid receptor expression and signaling efficiency.

"Empathy as a ""risky strength"": a multilevel examination of empathy and risk for internalizing disorders.","Tone, Erin B; Tully, Erin C","Learning to respond to others' distress with well-regulated empathy is an important developmental task linked to positive health outcomes and moral achievements. However, this important interpersonal skill set may also confer risk for depression and anxiety when present at extreme levels and in combination with certain individual characteristics or within particular contexts. The purpose of this review is to describe an empirically grounded theoretical rationale for the hypothesis that empathic tendencies can be ""risky strengths."" We propose a model in which typical development of affective and cognitive empathy can be influenced by complex interplay among intraindividual and interindividual moderators that increase risk for empathic personal distress and excessive interpersonal guilt. These intermediate states in turn precipitate internalizing problems that map onto empirically derived fear/arousal and anhedonia/misery subfactors of internalizing disorders. The intraindividual moderators include a genetically influenced propensity toward physiological hyperarousal, which is proposed to interact with genetic propensity to empathic sensitivity to contribute to neurobiological processes that underlie personal distress responses to others' pain or unhappiness. This empathic personal distress then increases risk for internalizing problems, particularly fear/arousal symptoms. In a similar fashion, interactions between genetic propensities toward negative thinking processes and empathic sensitivity are hypothesized to contribute to excess interpersonal guilt in response to others' distress. This interpersonal guilt then increases the risk for internalizing problems, especially anhedonia/misery symptoms. Interindividual moderators, such as maladaptive parenting or chronic exposure to parents' negative affect, further interact with these genetic liabilities to amplify risk for personal distress and interpersonal guilt as well as for consequent internalizing problems. Age-related increases in the heritability of depression, anxiety, and empathy-related constructs are consistent with developmental shifts toward greater influence of intraindividual moderators throughout childhood and adolescence, with interindividual moderators exerting their greatest influence during early childhood. Efforts to modulate neurobiological and behavioral expressions of genetic dysregulation liabilities and to promote adaptive empathic skills must thus begin early in development.",2014,Nov,Development and psychopathology,26,4 Pt 2,1547-1565,25422978,10.1017/S0954579414001199,25422978,#1410,Tone 2014,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Cumulative risk on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) underpins empathic communication difficulties at the first stages of romantic love.,"Schneiderman, Inna; Kanat-Maymon, Yaniv; Ebstein, Richard P; Feldman, Ruth","Empathic communication between couples plays an important role in relationship quality and individual well-being and research has pointed to the role of oxytocin in providing the neurobiological substrate for pair-bonding and empathy. Here, we examined links between genetic variability on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and empathic behaviour at the initiation of romantic love. Allelic variations on five OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with susceptibility to disorders of social functioning were genotyped in 120 new lovers: OXTRrs13316193, rs2254298, rs1042778, rs2268494 and rs2268490. Cumulative genetic risk was computed by summing risk alleles on each SNP. Couples were observed in support-giving interaction and behaviour was coded for empathic communication, including affective congruence, maintaining focus on partner, acknowledging partner's distress, reciprocal exchange and non-verbal empathy. Hierarchical linear modelling indicated that individuals with high OXTR risk exhibited difficulties in empathic communication. OXTR risk predicted empathic difficulties above and beyond the couple level, relationship duration, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Differences between patients with borderline personality disorder who do and do not have a family history of bipolar disorder.,"Zimmerman, Mark; Martinez, Jennifer; Young, Diane; Chelminski, Iwona; Dalrymple, Kristy","Diagnostic confusion sometimes exists between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD). To improve the recognition of bipolar disorder researchers have identified nondiagnostic factors that point toward bipolar disorder. One such factor is the presence of a family history of bipolar disorder. In the current report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we compared the demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics of patients with BPD who did and did not have a family history of bipolar disorder. A large sample of psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with semi-structured interviews. Three hundred seventeen patients without bipolar disorder were diagnosed with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder. Slightly less than 10% of the 317 patients with BPD (9.5%, n=30) reported a family history of bipolar disorder in their first-degree relatives. There were no differences between groups in any specific Axis I or Axis II disorder. The patients with a positive family history were significantly less likely to report excessive or inappropriate anger, but there was no difference in the frequency of other criteria for BPD such as affective instability, impulsivity, or suicidal behavior. The patients with a positive family history reported a significantly higher rate of increased appetite and fatigue. There was no difference in overall severity of depression, scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning, history of psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts, time unemployed due to psychiatric reasons during the 5 years before the evaluation, and ratings of current and adolescent social functioning.

What might offset this risky combination of genes and environment? We hypothesized that individual-level factors may play a protective role.

At-risk children (short-allele carriers in high-stress contexts) exhibited more depressive symptoms than other groups. Importantly, at-risk children who used effective emotion regulation did not exhibit increased depressive symptoms.

The vertebrate-specific astrotactins, ASTN2 and its paralog ASTN1, have key roles in glial-guided neuronal migration during brain development. To determine the prevalence of astrotactin mutations and delineate their associated phenotypic spectrum, we screened ASTN2/TRIM32 and ASTN1 (1q25.2) for exonic CNVs in clinical microarray data from 89 985 individuals across 10 sites, including 64 114 NDD subjects. In this clinical dataset, we identified 46 deletions and 12 duplications affecting ASTN2. Deletions of ASTN1 were much rarer. Deletions near the 3' terminus of ASTN2, which would disrupt all transcript isoforms (a subset of these deletions also included TRIM32), were significantly enriched in the NDD subjects (P = 0.002) compared with 44 085 population-based controls. Frequent phenotypes observed in individuals with such deletions include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech delay, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The 3'-terminal ASTN2 deletions were significantly enriched compared with controls in males with NDDs, but not in females. Upon quantifying ASTN2 human brain RNA, we observed shorter isoforms expressed from an alternative transcription start site of recent evolutionary origin near the 3' end. Spatiotemporal expression profiling in the human brain revealed consistently high ASTN1 expression while ASTN2 expression peaked in the early embryonic neocortex and postnatal cerebellar cortex.

We examined the phenotypic correlation between binge eating episodes and indices of personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and control/impulsivity). For correlations ≥|0.20|, we estimated the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contributed to this correlation. Participants included 3,446 European American same-sex female twins from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study (median age = 22 years). Binge eating episode was assessed via interview questions. Personality traits were assessed by self-report questionnaires. There was a significant moderate phenotypic correlation between binge eating episode and neuroticism (r = 0.33) as well as conscientiousness (r = -0.21), while other correlations were significant but smaller (r ranging from -0.14 to 0.14). Individual differences in binge eating episodes, neuroticism, and conscientiousness were attributed to additive genetic influences (38% [95% CI: 21-53%], 45% [95% CI: 38-52%], and 44% [95% CI: 0.33-0.55%] respectively), with the remaining variance attributed to individual-specific environmental influences. Covariance was attributable to genetic (neuroticism r g = 0.37; conscientiousness r g = -0.22) and individual-specific environmental (neuroticism r e = 0.28; conscientiousness r e = -0.19) influences.

The FKBP5 gene product modulates glucocorticoid receptor function and has been previously associated with differential hippocampal structure, function, and affect disorder risk. Thus, FKBP5 is an attractive genetic target for investigations of PC integrity. We examined associations between PC integrity, measured through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional anisotropy (FA; an index of white matter integrity), and polymorphisms in the FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 in a sample of 82 traumatized female civilians. Findings indicated that, compared with individuals without this allele, individuals who carried two 'risk' alleles for this FKBP5 SNP (T allele; previously associated with mood and anxiety disorder risk) demonstrated significantly lower FA in the left PC, even after statistically controlling for variance associated with age, trauma exposure, and PTSD symptoms.

Specifically, with low childhood stress, G homozygotes exhibited lower levels of negative emotionality associated with greater rVLPFC activation, suggesting that the rVLPFC is involved in reappraisal that neutralizes negative emotional responses. In addition, we found that genotype indirectly modulated excessive alcohol consumption (p &amp;lt; 0.05, N = 69). Specifically, G homozygotes showed greater rVLPFC activation and had lower levels of negative emotionality, which were associated with fewer binge-drinking days and fewer alcohol related problems.

We investigated whether CHD contributes to the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and neurocognitive impairments in 22q11DS. Fifty-four children ages 8-14 years with 22q11DS and 16 age-matched non-deleted children with CHD participated. They were assessed using semi-structured interviews and a Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. CHD status was assessed using available medical records.

There were no significant differences between the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the 22q11DS with and without CHD. In 22q11DS with CHD, the prevalence rates were 41% anxiety disorders, 37% ADHD and 71% psychosis spectrum.

Though parents with BPD are aware of increased risk to children, little is known about efforts undertaken in response or their perceived utility. Among parents who self-report with BPD, this study identifies key variables associated with parental coping with children's risk of mood disorders; and explores the relationship between monitoring children's moods and perceived coping efficacy. In this U.S. study, active parental coping with, and cognitive distancing from, child's risk were measured using novel scales. Parents (n = 266) who self-identified as having BPD completed a web-based survey. They had at least one unaffected child. Most participants endorsed monitoring their children's moods. Monitoring was associated with increased perceived control over the child's well-being (p &amp;lt; 0.005), but not feeling less worried.

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome as a window into complex neuropsychiatric disorders over the lifespan.,"Jonas, Rachel K; Montojo, Caroline A; Bearden, Carrie E","Evidence is rapidly accumulating that rare, recurrent copy number variants represent large effect risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) (velocardiofacial syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome) is the most common known contiguous gene deletion syndrome and is associated with diverse neuropsychiatric disorders across the life span. One of the most intriguing aspects of the syndrome is the variability in clinical and cognitive presentation: children with 22q11DS have high prevalence of autism spectrum, attention deficit, and anxiety disorders, as well as psychotic-like features, and up to 30% of adolescents and adults develop schizophrenia-like psychosis. Recently, cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease in adults have been reported, collectively suggesting a role for disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission in the observed neuropsychiatric phenotypes. There is also some evidence that 22q11DS-associated autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia represent two unrelated phenotypic manifestations, consistent with a neuropsychiatric pleiotropy model. This genetic lesion thus provides a unique model for the discovery of specific genomic risk and (potentially) protective factors for neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we provide an overview of neuropsychiatric findings to date, which highlight the value of this syndrome in mapping the developmental trajectory of dimensional phenotypes that traverse multiple diagnostic categories. Potential sources of genetic variability that may contribute to the disorder's heterogeneous presentation are reviewed.

Complex phenotypes like depression, however, are likely determined by multiple variants in interaction with environmental factors. As variations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2) have been related to a higher risk for depression, we investigated whether NR3C2 variance is related to negative memory bias, an established endophenotype for depression, in healthy participants. Furthermore, we explored the influence of life adversity on this association. We used a set-based analysis to simultaneously test all measured variation in NR3C2 for an association with negative memory bias in 483 participants and an interaction with life adversity. To further specify this interaction, we split the sample into low and high live adversity groups and repeated the analyses in both groups separately.

Recently, copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in different neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD. Based on these previous reports that focused on pediatric cohorts, we hypothesize that structural variants may also contribute to adult ADHD and that such genomic variation may be enriched for CNVs previously identified in children with ADHD. To address this issue, we performed for the first time a whole-genome CNV study on 400 adults with ADHD and 526 screened controls.

The association between CHRN genetic variants and dizziness at first inhalation of cigarette smoke.,"Pedneault, Maxime; Labbe, Aurélie; Roy-Gagnon, Marie-Hélène; Low, Nancy C; Dugas, Erika; Engert, James C; O'Loughlin, Jennifer","Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiple nicotinic receptor genes (CHRN) are associated with smoking. However few studies have examined the association between CHRN SNPs and subjective responses to smoking in adolescents which may relate to sustained smoking, such as dizziness at first inhalation. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between 61 SNPs in eight CHRN genes (CHRNA3, CHRNA4, CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA7, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, CHRNB4) and dizziness at first inhalation. Data were available from a longitudinal cohort investigation of 1293 students 12-13year-old at baseline. Students completed self-report questionnaires at school every 3months for 5years during secondary school, and a mailed questionnaire three years later. DNA extracted from blood or saliva was genotyped for 61 CHRN SNPs selected using a gene tagging approach. Associations were modeled using logistic regression controlling for sex, race and age at first cigarette. Complete data were available for 356 of 475 participants (75%) who initiated smoking. The minor alleles of three SNPs in CHRNA6 (rs7812298, rs2304297, rs7828365) were associated with a decreased probability of dizziness (OR(95% CI)=0.54 (0.36, 0.81), 0.59 (0.40, 0.86) and 0.58 (0.36, 0.95), respectively), while one SNP in each of three other genes (rs3743077 (CHRNA3), rs755204 (CHRNA4), rs7178176 (CHRNA7)) was associated with an increased probability of dizziness (OR(95% CI)=1.40 (1.02, 1.90), 1.85 (1.05, 3.27) and 1.51 (1.06, 2.15), respectively).

Genetic loci have not yet been identified by genome-wide association studies. Rare copy number variations (CNVs), such as chromosomal deletions or duplications, have been implicated in ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. To identify rare (frequency ≤1%) CNVs that increase the risk of ADHD, we performed a whole-genome CNV analysis based on 489 young ADHD patients and 1285 adult population-based controls and identified one significantly associated CNV region. In tests for a global burden of large (&amp;gt;500 kb) rare CNVs, we observed a nonsignificant (P=0.271) 1.126-fold enriched rate of subjects carrying at least one such CNV in the group of ADHD cases. Locus-specific tests of association were used to assess if there were more rare CNVs in cases compared with controls. Detected CNVs, which were significantly enriched in the ADHD group, were validated by quantitative (q)PCR. Findings were replicated in an independent sample of 386 young patients with ADHD and 781 young population-based healthy controls. We identified rare CNVs within the parkinson protein 2 gene (PARK2) with a significantly higher prevalence in ADHD patients than in controls (P=2.8 × 10(-4) after empirical correction for genome-wide testing). In total, the PARK2 locus (chr 6: 162 659 756-162 767 019) harboured three deletions and nine duplications in the ADHD patients and two deletions and two duplications in the controls. By qPCR analysis, we validated 11 of the 12 CNVs in ADHD patients (P=1.2 × 10(-3) after empirical correction for genome-wide testing). In the replication sample, CNVs at the PARK2 locus were found in four additional ADHD patients and one additional control (P=4.3 × 10(-2)).

Of the few reports that have focused on early smoking behaviors, association results have been mixed. This meta-analysis examines early smoking phenotypes and SNPs in the gene cluster to determine: (1) whether the most robust association signal in this region (rs16969968) for other smoking behaviors is also associated with early behaviors, and/or (2) if additional statistically independent signals are important in early smoking. We focused on two phenotypes: age of tobacco initiation (AOI) and age of first regular tobacco use (AOS). This study included 56,034 subjects (41 groups) spanning nine countries and evaluated five SNPs including rs1948, rs16969968, rs578776, rs588765, and rs684513. Each dataset was analyzed using a centrally generated script. Meta-analyses were conducted from summary statistics. AOS yielded significant associations with SNPs rs578776 (beta = 0.02, P = 0.004), rs1948 (beta = 0.023, P = 0.018), and rs684513 (beta = 0.032, P = 0.017), indicating protective effects. There were no significant associations for the AOI phenotype. Importantly, rs16969968, the most replicated signal in this region for nicotine dependence, cigarettes per day, and cotinine levels, was not associated with AOI (P = 0.59) or AOS (P = 0.92).

Brain circuits that link schizophrenia to high risk of cigarette smoking.,"Moran, Lauren V; Sampath, Hemalatha; Kochunov, Peter; Hong, L Elliot","Schizophrenia is associated with a high prevalence of smoking. Functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and limbic regions including the ventral striatum, extended amygdala and parahippocampal areas has been previously implicated in the genetics and clinical severity of smoking. In this study, we test the hypothesis that dACC functional circuits are key paths for the high risk of smoking comorbidity in schizophrenia. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed using the dACC as a seed region in smoking and nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia (n = 54), matched controls (n = 65), and nonpsychotic first-degree relatives (n = 24). Multiple regions had decreased connectivity with the dACC in schizophrenia patients when compared with matched controls (n = 65). Several of these functional circuits were also associated with nicotine addiction severity; the largest cluster included limbic areas such as the parahippocampal, extended amygdala, ventral striatal, and posterior insula regions, indicating an overlap of schizophrenia and nicotine addiction on to this circuit. These same functional connectivity-defined circuits were also significantly impaired in schizophrenia nonsmokers compared with control nonsmokers and in nonpsychotic first-degree relatives. Functional connectivity between the dACC and limbic regions is inherently abnormal in schizophrenia, related to its genetic liability regardless of smoking, and overlaps with a nicotine addiction-related circuit.

Genetic marker of norepinephrine synthesis predicts individual differences in post-error slowing: a pilot study.,"Colzato, Lorenza S; de Rover, Mischa; van den Wildenberg, Wery P M; Nieuwenhuis, Sander","When our brain detects the commission of an error, we slow down immediately thereafter: a phenomenon called post-error slowing (PES). Some researchers have speculated that slowing after unexpected errors or negative feedback is related to the activity of the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.

In a sample of 100 healthy adults, we studied the dependency of an individual's size of PES on the DBH5'-ins/del polymorphism-a variation in the DBH gene associated with the production of the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. DBH5'-ins/del heterozygotes, who have intermediate levels of plasma DβH activity, showed increased PES in a Simon task compared to del/del homozygotes and ins/ins homozygotes, who have low and high levels of plasma DβH activity, respectively.

Acute anxiolytic effects of quetiapine during virtual reality exposure--a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with specific phobia.,"Diemer, Julia; Domschke, Katharina; Mühlberger, Andreas; Winter, Bernward; Zavorotnyy, Maxim; Notzon, Swantje; Silling, Karen; Arolt, Volker; Zwanzger, Peter","Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric disorders. With regard to pharmacological treatment, antidepressants, the calcium modulator pregabalin and benzodiazepines are recommended according to current treatment guidelines. With regard to acute states of anxiety, so far practically only benzodiazepines provide an immediate anxiolytic effect. However, the risk of tolerance and dependency limits the use of this class of medication. Therefore, there is still a need for alternative pharmacologic strategies. Increasing evidence points towards anxiety-reducing properties of atypical antipsychotics, particularly quetiapine. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the putative acute anxiolytic effects of this compound, choosing the induction of acute anxiety in patients with specific phobia as a model for the evaluation of ad-hoc anxiolytic properties in a proof-of-concept approach. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 58 patients with arachnophobia were treated with a single dose of quetiapine XR or placebo prior to a virtual reality spider challenge procedure. Treatment effects were monitored using rating scales for acute anxiety as well as measurements of heart rate and skin conductance. Overall, quetiapine showed significant anxiolytic effects compared to placebo. However, effects were not seen on the primary outcome measure (VAS Anxiety), but were limited to somatic anxiety symptoms. Additionally, a significant reduction of skin conductance was observed. Further exploratory analyses hint towards a mediating role of the (COMT) val158met genotype on treatment response.

We examined the associations of AD with 22 SNPs across HTR3A, HTR3B, and two functional variants in SLC6A4 in 500 AD and 280 healthy control individuals of European descent.

"Computerized facial analysis for understanding constricted/blunted affect: initial feasibility, reliability, and validity data.","Cohen, Alex S; Morrison, Sean C; Callaway, Dallas A","Diminished expression is a diagnostic feature of a range of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders/conditions and is often unresponsive to treatment, is present across premorbid, first episode and various clinical states, and is considered a poor prognostic indicator. Surprisingly, little is known about diminished expression. The present study sought to address this issue by evaluating a commercially-available computerized facial analysis software for understanding diminished expressivity. We analyzed natural facial expression from a series of laboratory interaction tasks in 28 individuals with psychometric schizotypy - defined as the personality organization reflecting a putative genetic schizophrenia liability, and 26 matched controls. We evaluated (a) feasibility - defined in terms of the number of video frames recognized by the software, (b) reliability - defined in terms of correlations between facial expression variables across the three laboratory interactions, and (c) construct validity - defined in terms of relationships to clinical variables. For most subjects (~80%), approximately three-quarters of the video frames were analyzable by the software; however, a minority of the videos were essentially unreadable. The facial expression variables showed excellent reliability across interaction conditions. In terms of construct validity, facial expression variables were significantly related to a measure of psychoticism, tapping subjective cognitive concerns and ""first-rank"" schizophrenia symptoms, but were generally not different between groups. Facial expression variables were generally not significantly related to measures of depression, anxiety, paranoia or, surprisingly, self-reported negative schizotypy.

First, using a subsample of twins (N = 2,877), we used standard twin models to estimate the additive genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental contributions to these five traits. Heritabilities ranged from .42 to .58 and shared environmental effects ranged from .12 to .24. Phenotypic correlations among the five traits were largely attributable to shared genetic effects. Second, we used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) to estimate as a random effect the aggregate genetic effect attributable to 515,384 common SNPs. The aggregated SNPs explained 10-30 % of the variance in the traits. Third, a genome-wide scoring approach summed the actual SNPs, creating a SNP-based genetic risk score for each individual. After tenfold internal cross-validation, the SNP sumscore correlated with the traits at .03 to .07 (p &amp;lt; .05), indicating small but detectable effects.

However, empirical data on the interplay between specific genes and adverse experiences are few. The COMT Val158Met and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotypes have been suggested to affect both stress sensitivity and the risk for alcohol dependence. This study tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in COMT Val158Met and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A interacts with childhood adverse experiences to predict alcohol dependence. Male abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (n = 110) and age-matched healthy male controls (n = 99) were genotyped for the COMT Val158Met and the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotypes. Childhood adverse events were measured using three self-report questionnaires. Alcohol dependence severity, age of onset and duration of alcohol dependence were analyzed as secondary outcome measures. Statistical analysis involved logistic regression analysis and analysis of variance. Alcohol-dependent patients reported increased childhood adversity. The interaction between childhood adversity and the COMT Val158Met genotype added significantly to the prediction model. This gene-environment interaction was confirmed in the analysis of the secondary outcome measures, i.e. alcohol dependence severity, age of onset and duration of alcohol dependence. The DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotype was not related to alcohol dependence, nor did it interact with childhood adversity in predicting alcohol dependence.

A proportion of cases are due to mutations in the maternally imprinted SGCE gene. Previous studies have suggested that patients with SGCE mutations may have an increased rate of psychiatric disorders. We established a cohort of patients with myoclonus dystonia syndrome and SGCE mutations to determine the extent to which psychiatric disorders form part of the disease phenotype. In all, 89 patients with clinically suspected myoclonus dystonia syndrome were recruited from the UK and Ireland. SGCE was analysed using direct sequencing and for copy number variants. In those patients where no mutation was found TOR1A (GAG deletion), GCH1, THAP1 and NKX2-1 were also sequenced. SGCE mutation positive cases were systematically assessed using standardized psychiatric interviews and questionnaires and compared with a disability-matched control group of patients with alcohol responsive tremor. Nineteen (21%) probands had a SGCE mutation, five of which were novel. Recruitment of family members increased the affected SGCE mutation positive group to 27 of whom 21 (77%) had psychiatric symptoms.

Manifold implications of forgotten hyperglycemia in clinical opiate dependence.,"Reece, Albert Stuart","Both chronic opiate dependence and diabetes are widespread public health problems. The historically causal relationship between opiate pharmacology and hyperglycemia would appear to have fallen from current medical knowledge. The aims of this study were to assess the severity of hyperglycemia in our opiate substance use disorder (SUD) patient population and review its pathophysiological basis. A review was undertaken of our clinical pathology database, comparing SUD patients and general medical controls (NSUD). A total of 1,602 SUD patients were compared with 2,858 NSUD patients 15-50 years of age. Mean ages were 31.29 ± 7.40 and 31.55 ± 9.17 years, respectively (P = 0.42) and were 68.60 and 52.76% male (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level in diabetics was 8.14 ± 2.76 and 6.29 ± 1.88 (P = 0.0032). In a nested case-control subset, random glucose, HbA1c, and fructosamine levels were all significantly elevated (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Adjusted for age, the HbA1c level was elevated among the SUD group (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) the age at addiction interaction was also significant (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Serum glucose, HbA1c, fructosamine, and microalbumin levels were shown to be biomarkers of age. At multiple regression analysis, interactions between age, addictive status, glycemia, and the inflammatory markers, ethrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, were significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05). At age 50, diabetic SUD patients had a HbA1c of 8.31%, which was equivalent to that of NSUD patients at age 140.54 years, a 181.07% elevation.

However, their impact on psychological responses following physical trauma remains largely unexplored. Methods: Based on the China Severe Trauma Cohort, we conducted a cohort study of 2937 patients who were admitted to the Trauma Medical Center of West China Hospital between June 2020 and August 2023. Adverse life experiences, including childhood maltreatment (5 subtypes, measured by Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form) and adverse lifetime experiences (17 subtypes, by Life Events Checklist) were assessed. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the associations of childhood maltreatment and adverse lifetime experiences with symptoms of psychopathology measured at multiple time-points after the index injury (i.e., at recruitment, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups), adjusted for important confounders. We further stratified the analyses by level of genetic predisposition to a given psychological symptom quantified by polygenic risk score (PRS) based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the role of adverse lifetime experiences in connecting childhood maltreatment and post-injury psychopathology. Results: The mean age of participants was 47.95 years with a predominance of males (61.39%). During the whole follow-up period, the incidence of symptoms of stress-related disorders, anxiety, and depression was 13.86%, 29.89%, and 36.57%, respectively. We observed associations between the cumulative number of those studied adversities and increased risk of post-injury psychopathology, particularly stress-related disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87–4.12 for ≥ 2 vs no childhood maltreatment; 2.65 [1.67–4.20] for ≥ 4 vs 0–1 adverse lifetime experiences). By subtype, positive associations were observed for most studied life adversities, with the most pronounced estimates for childhood emotional abuse (ORs = 1.71–2.52) and lifetime life-threatening illness/injury (ORs = 1.87–2.89). We found basically comparable estimates among traumatized individuals with different PRSs for studied psychopathology. Moreover, adverse lifetime experiences may partially (mediation proportion: 22.52–27.48%) explain the associations between various childhood maltreatment and post-injury psychopathology.

Genetic risk predicts adolescent mood pathology via sexual differentiation of brain function and physiological aging,"Petrican, R.; Fornito, A.; Murgatroyd, C.; Boyland, E.; Hardman, C.A.","Recent evidence challenged the traditional, categorical approach to sex differences, indicating that each human brain comprises a mosaic of features, some of which are more common among males, others, among females, whereas the remaining are equally common between sexes. Thus, a focus on regional sexual differentiation of brain function, instead of holistic sex-based categorization, could be more useful for understanding psychiatric conditions, such as mood and behavioural disorders, to which males and females are differentially vulnerable. To probe this untested hypothesis, we estimate sexual differentiation within each brain in a longitudinal (N = 199) and cross-sectional (N = 277) sample of male and female adolescents. Greater feminization of association networks, involved in higher-order cognition, compared to sensory networks, at ages 9-10 correlates with earlier puberty and greater immune/metabolic dysregulation at ages 11-12, particularly among girls. Greater masculinization of association networks relates to later puberty and reduced immune/metabolic dysregulation, especially among boys. The brain and physiological profiles sequentially mediate the relationship between genetic risk and rising mood/behavioural symptoms. These links are replicated in the cross-sectional sample and shown to hold across sexes. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating assessments of regional sexual differentiation and physiology in personalizing psychiatric intervention in adolescence.",2025,,Nature Communications ,16,1,,,10.1038/s41467-025-60686-5,,#1551,Petrican 2025,"",""

While concussions are well-recognized, RHIs often lack immediate symptoms, potentially leading to gradual neurocognitive decline over time. This narrative review synthesizes current research on the effects of soccer heading on brain structure, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Advanced neuroimaging studies reveal that frequent heading is linked to microstructural changes in white matter, impaired neurovascular coupling, and an increased risk of neurodegenerative conditions, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Athletes with high exposure to heading frequently experience cognitive and psychological difficulties, including memory problems, executive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. The variability in research findings indicates that factors such as age, sex, heading technique, and overall exposure may influence individual vulnerability to RHIs.

We further examined the genetic influence and mediation effects of brain structure and function underlying the relationships. We found that all intensity levels of PA were associated with reduced internalizing and thought problems but not with externalizing problems. Durations of moderate activity around 90 min and vigorous activity around 120 min each day and frequency of physical exercise four days each week were associated with lowest MH burden. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neuropsychiatric disorders were associated with reduced step count and light activity, while PRS for walking was associated with reduced thought problems. Reduced functional connectivity between cingulo-parietal and auditory networks, and between cingulo-opercular network and left putamen is the common neural pathways mediating the associations between different PA measurements and better mental health.

Predictors of Environmental Sensitivity in Syrian refugee children,"May, A.K.; Smeeth, D.; McEwen, F.; Karam, E.; Pluess, M.","BACKGROUND: Although more prone to psychopathology on average, refugee children differ in their response to adversity. Growing evidence attributes some of these individual differences to varying levels of Environmental Sensitivity - the extent to which children perceive and process contextual influences. However, there is limited knowledge of how Environmental Sensitivity is developmentally influenced, particularly in the refugee setting. METHODS: Here, we investigated whether individual-, family- and community-level predictors (psychosocial and genetic) were associated with self-reported Environmental Sensitivity and its subscales (measured using the 12-item Highly Sensitive Child Scale). Participants were a subsample (n = 1,409) from a cohort of Syrian refugee children and their biological mothers, recruited from informal tented settlements in Lebanon. Multivariate adaptive regression spline models were fitted to identify the best selection from over 40 available predictors. RESULTS: Twelve predictors of Environmental Sensitivity emerged, with the five most commonly selected being maternal behavioural control, human insecurity, positive home experiences, maternal anxiety and child-reported child abuse, the latter three of which were also suggested to predict changes in sensitivity over a 12-month period. Some predictors such as maternal PTSD, war exposure and bullying showed a non-linear, V-shape relationship with sensitivity. All effect sizes, however, were small. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both highly supportive and highly adverse contextual factors associate with greater childhood Environmental Sensitivity, in line with current theorising.

Genetic Confounding in the Association between Traumatic Brain Injury and Mental Disorder or Suicide,"Østergaard, S.D.; Mundy, J.; Hall, A.S.M.; Musliner, K.L.","Importance: Traumatic brain injury is common and occurs across all ages. Observational studies have shown that traumatic brain injury is associated with a wide range of mental disorders and suicide. Whether these associations represent a causal effect is, however, difficult to establish, and confounding by genetic liability for mental disorder may play a substantial role. Objective: To investigate whether observational associations between traumatic brain injury and mental disorder or suicide could be confounded by genetic liability for mental disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from October 2023 to January 2025. The study population consisted of the general population subcohort of the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH) sample, which is a representative sample of the Danish population born between 1981 and 2008 that has been genotyped. Exposures: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) calculated from the genotypes and genome-wide association summary statistics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was traumatic brain injury, operationalized via hospital diagnoses. The associations between PRSs for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and ADHD, respectively, and traumatic brain injury were examined via Cox proportional hazards regression, yielding hazard rate ratios (HRRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Results: The final cohort consisted of a total of 40274 individuals, of whom 19802 (49.2%) were female. A total of 3341 (8.3%) of the cohort members (of whom 1464 [43.8%] were female and 1877 [56.2%] were male) experienced traumatic brain injury during follow-up.

It focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as HTR1A, TPH2, COMT, DRD2, and BDNF, examining their connections to symptoms like depression, post-traumatic stress, panic, general anxiety, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Utilizing advanced network modeling based on the Ising model, we analyzed a sample of 312 twins (240 females; Mage = 25.14; SD = 7.81). This method estimates networks of items/symptoms and gene variants, providing insights into gene-symptom relationships.

In contrast, BDNF and TPH2 exhibit no significant relations to internalizing symptoms. The findings also reveal non-linear associations between symptoms and specific genes, with central symptoms in the network correlated to certain gene risk variants. A notable result is the lack of association between serotonin genes and depression, indicating the complexity of depressive symptoms’ genetic underpinnings. Strong genetic bases for social phobia and agoraphobia symptoms were observed, along with PTSD symptoms associated with the DRD2 gene.

However, no research has yet comprehensively verified and compared the independent, multiplicative (interactive), and cumulative (additive) effects of these stresses on depressive symptoms. Consequently, the mechanisms by which early and recent stress contribute to depressive symptoms, as well as the extent of individual differences in these processes, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to address this gap by simultaneously examining the independent, multiplicative, and cumulative effects of recent stressful life events and adverse childhood events on depressive symptoms in late adolescence. Additionally, it investigated the moderating role of multilocus genetic variations related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis within these models. A theory-driven multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) was calculated using FKBP5 rs1360780, NR3C1 rs41423247, and CRHR1 rs110402 polymorphisms. The study recruited a sample of 1227 adolescents (Mage = 18.94 ± 0.70 years, 56.8% girls) from one vocational college, two general colleges and two universities. Results showed that both the independent and cumulative effects of recent stressful life events and adverse childhood events on depressive symptoms were significant, while the multiplicative effects were non-significant. Moreover, the independent effects model was more explanatory than the cumulative effects model, with recent stressful life events being the primary contributor. A significant moderating effect of MGPS on the association between recent stressful life events and depressive symptoms was also observed. Specifically, those with higher MGPS, i.e., with higher susceptibility, exhibited more depressive symptoms when exposed to higher levels of recent stressful life events but fewer symptoms when exposed to lower levels. These findings deepen the understanding of how early and recent stress, along with genetic factors, influence depressive symptoms.

However, research shows inconsistencies. Here, we examined associations between air pollution and surrounding greenness with internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In addition, the potential modifying role of the genetic susceptibility for these traits and socioeconomic status (SES) was explored. Methods: This population-based study included 4485 schoolchildren aged 5–18 years from Spain. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Average air pollution (NO2, PM2.5, PM10, PMcoarse, and PM2.5 absorbance) and surrounding greenness (NDVI within 100-m, 300-m, and 500-m buffers) school exposure were estimated for 12 months before outcome assessment. Genetic liability was assessed by computing polygenic risk scores (PRS) and SES was calculated using the Hollingshead Four-Factor Index. Associations were analyzed using negative binomial mixed-effects models. Results: Although no associations survived multiple testing, we found that increases of 5.48 μg/m3 in PM10 and 2.93 μg/m3 in PMcoarse were associated with a 6% (Mean Ratio (MR) = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01–1.12) and a 4% (MR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00–1.09) increase in internalizing behavior scores. A 0.1 increase in NDVI within a 100-m buffer was associated with a 6% decrease in externalizing behavior (MR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89–0.99). Neither differences by sex or age, or moderation effects by PRS or SES, were observed. Conclusions: We found preliminary evidence of detrimental effects of air pollution on internalizing behavior and protective effects of greenness on externalizing behavior, which were not modified by sex, age, SES, or genetic liability.

Analysis of gut microbiota and depression and anxiety: Mendelian randomization from three datasets,"Lai, Y.; Xiong, P.","Background: Emerging evidence supports gut microbiota's association with mental distress, particularly depression and anxiety, the microbiota-gut-brain axis was the believed to be the underlying mechanism. This study investigated the causal relationships between specific gut microbiota and depression and anxiety disorders using large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Methods: A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to explore the causal effects of 211 microbial taxa on depression and anxiety across three large GWAS databases: FinnGen, Pan-UKBB, and PGC. Sensitive analyses were followed to validate the robustness of results. Random-effect meta-analysis was further performed to enhance the statistical power. Results: The MR analysis revealed that the Bifidobacteriales (IVW: OR 0.90, 95 %CI 0.83 to 0.98) and Bifidobacteriaceae (IVW: OR 0.90, 95 %CI 0.83 to 0.98) had a protective effect against depression.

To which degree the different dMRI metrics relate to clinically relevant geno- and phenotypes is still debated. Hence, we investigate how tract-based and whole WM skeleton parameters from different dMRI approaches associate with clinically relevant and white matter-related phenotypes (sex, age, pulse pressure (PP), body-mass-index (BMI), brain asymmetry) and genetic markers in the UK Biobank (UKB, n=52,140) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n=5,844). In general, none of the imaging approaches could explain all examined phenotypes, though the approaches were overall similar in explaining variability of the examined phenotypes. Nevertheless, particular diffusion parameters of the used dMRI approaches stood out in explaining some important phenotypes known to correlate with general human health outcomes. A multi-compartment Bayesian dMRI approach provided the strongest WM associations with age, and together with diffusion tensor imaging, the largest accuracy for sex-classifications. We find a similar pattern of metric and tract-dependent asymmetries across datasets, with stronger asymmetries in ABCD data. The magnitude of WM associations with polygenic scores as well as PP depended more on the sample, and likely age, than dMRI metrics.

EXAMINING THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF SMARTPHONE OVERUSE: A PATH TO ACHIEVING DIGITAL WELL-BEING-A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Mazumdar, A.","Epidemiological Context and Research Gaps: Emerging epidemiological trends demonstrate a rise in screen-mediated pathologies, including metabolic dysregulation, circadian rhythm disruptions, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, necessitating evidence-based public health interventions. Current literature exhibits critical gaps in elucidating neurocognitive mechanisms driving wireless mobile device (WMD) dependency and standardized mitigation protocols. Study Objectives: This systematic review investigates the neurocognitive and behavioral mechanisms underlying WMD overuse, evaluates associated multisystem health sequelae, and proposes evidence-based mitigation strategies for sustainable digital well-being. Methodological Approach: A systematic literature review (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library) identified peer-reviewed studies (2010–2024) examining smartphone overuse, screen time, and digital addiction phenotypes. Inclusion criteria encompassed cross-sectional, longitudinal, and interventional studies across all age groups and geographic regions. 1.Neurobiological Correlates: Chronic WMD engagement induces neuroplastic adaptations in prefrontal cortical regions, with dopaminergic dysregulation perpetuating compulsive checking behaviors through reinforced habit-loop cycles. 2. Metabolic Consequences: Screen time-BMI correlations (β=0.32, p<0.001) demonstrated multifactorial etiology, mediated by attentional disinhibition during feeding, hyperpalatable food marketing exposure, and leptin resistance from sedentary behaviors. 3.Sleep Architecture Disruption: Nocturnal WMD engagement precipitated delayed sleep onset (Δ=43 min, p=0.004), melatonin suppression (18.7% reduction), and fragmented REM cycles, exacerbating diurnal cognitive impairment and affective disorders. 4.Population-Level Impacts: Population-based studies indicate only 4.9% of adolescents meet combined sleep, activity, and screen time guidelines, with WMD overuse constituting the primary compliance barrier. 5. Psychosocial Consequences: Upward social comparison dynamics on curated digital platforms correlated with diminished self-worth (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.7–2.6) and occupational dissatisfaction, independent of socioeconomic status. Synthesis and Implications: A paradigm of moderated utilization emerges as critical, integrating: a) Behavioral modification techniques: Stimulus control through notification rationalization and WMD triage protocols b) Environmental restructuring: Creation of device-free zones and chromatic filtering to reduce blue light exposure. c)Cognitive reinforcement: Mindfulness-based intervention modules targeting attentional resource allocation.

Recent studies suggest that different domains of psychotic symptoms could be associated with distinct risk factors, but less is known about PLEs. This study clustered PLEs into subgroups and explored the genetic and environmental characteristics associated with these profiles. Methods: Data from children (N = 11,854) recruited as part of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study v5.1 assessed PLEs using 21-items from the Prodromal-Questionnaire-Brief Child Version. K-medoid clustering of PLEs was conducted among children with at least one distressing PLE item at baseline (n = 3155). Associations of polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (PRS-SCZ) and social-environmental characteristics with PLE subgroups were estimated using generalized multinomial mixed models, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, income-to-needs ratio, and family history of psychosis. Results: We identified three distressing PLE subgroups: hallucinatory-like (n = 1110), paranoid-like (n = 1229), and multiple PLE domains (n = 816). Compared to those without any distressing PLEs (n = 8699), those with hallucinatory-like PLE were more likely to have had prenatal cannabis exposure (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.578, 95 % CI: 1.231–2.023); paranoid-like individuals had higher PRS-SCZ (OR = 1.080, 95 % CI: 1.001–1.166); those with multiple PLE domains participated in less physical activities (OR = 0.880, 95 % CI: 0.803–0.964).

Stress reactivity moderates the association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in adolescents: Results from a population-based study,"Baltramonaityte, V.; Lussier, A.A.; Smith, A.D.A.C.; Simpkin, A.J.; Fairchild, G.; Dunn, E.C.; Walton, E.","Background: A large body of evidence links stressful life events with depression. However, little is understood about the role of perceived impact in this association. Methods: We performed regression analysis to investigate whether self-reported stress reactivity (derived by regressing the impact-weighted life event score on the unweighted score) moderated the association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 4791), controlling for age at outcome, sex, ethnicity, and maternal education. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-report Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (score range 0–26) at 16 years of age. Adolescents also reported on their exposure to 23 possible stressful life events since age 12 and their impact, which were used to define stress reactivity groups using a residual regression approach. Results: We identified a moderating effect of stress reactivity. Adolescents with high stress reactivity showed a stronger association between the number of stressful life events and depressive symptoms than adolescents with low (b = 0.32, 95 % CI = 0.13, 0.50, p < 0.001) or typical (b = 0.44, 95 % CI = 0.28, 0.60, p < 0.001) stress reactivity. Limitations: Limitations include the use of retrospective life event measures and limited generalisability of findings to other population-based, high-risk, or clinical samples.

The development of an environmental risk score using Swedish National Registers and its impact on subsequent episodes of major depression,"Kendler, K.S.; Lönn, S.L.; Sundquist, J.; Sundquist, K.","BACKGROUND: Stressful life events (SLEs) increase the risk for subsequent major depression (MD) episodes. Most prior studies of SLEs utilized questionnaires or interview-based assessments. We sought to develop and evaluate an environmental risk score (ERS) for MD from multiple classes of SLEs obtained from national Swedish registries. METHODS: We assessed, in the entire adult population of Sweden (n = 7,105,712), the occurrence of 52 categories of SLEs derived from registry information for the 6 months prior to January 9, 2010 and the risk for MD registration over the subsequent 6 months. Weights for our ERS were obtained from a random half of our sample and ERS and its relationship to MD risk was evaluated in the second half. RESULTS: The ERS was robustly related to risk for subsequent MD episodes. Women were more sensitive to the depressogenic effect of the ERS than men. Those with prior episodes of MD had larger absolute increases in MD risk from our ERS than those without previous episodes. Genetic risk for MD was associated with a greater sensitivity to the depressogenic effects of the ERS. A co-sibling control analysis suggested that most, but not all, of the association between ERS and subsequent risk for MD was causal. CONCLUSIONS: Valid measures of SLEs that predispose to risk for MD can be assessed from high-quality registry data. While not all event categories (e.g. interpersonal or romantic difficulties) can be assessed, this method avoids problems with accurate dating and recall bias and can be performed in very large samples.",2025,,Psychological medicine,55,"(Kendler K.S.)

Association Analysis of Rare CNTN5 Variants With Autism Spectrum Disorder in a Japanese Population,"Hadi, A.F.; Arta, R.K.; Kushima, I.; Egawa, J.; Watanabe, Y.; Ozaki, N.; Someya, T.","Background: Contactin-5 (CNTN5), a neural adhesion molecule involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation in the auditory pathway, has been associated with the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly hyperacusis. To investigate the role of rare CNTN5 variants in ASD susceptibility, we performed resequencing and association analysis in a Japanese population. Methods: We resequenced the CNTN5 coding regions in 302 patients with ASD and prioritized rare putatively damaging variants. The prioritized variants were then genotyped in 313 patients with ASD and 1065 controls. Subsequently, we conducted an association study of selected variants with ASD in 614 patients with ASD and 61 057 controls. Clinical data were reviewed for patients carrying prioritized variants. Results: Through resequencing, we prioritized three rare putatively damaging missense variants (W69G, I227L, and L1000S) in patients with ASD. Although we found a nominally significant association between the I227L variant and ASD, it did not remain significant after post hoc correction. Hyperacusis was found in three out of nine patients carrying prioritized variants. Conclusion: This study does not provide evidence for the contribution of rare CNTN5 variants to the genetic etiology of ASD in the Japanese population.",2025,,Neuropsychopharmacology Reports,45,1,,,10.1002/npr2.12527,,#1613,Hadi 2025,"",""
"Genetic Association Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Sarcopenia: A Bidirectional Two-Sample, Two-Step Mendelian Randomized Study","Zhao, X.; Jin, Y.; Ma, L.; Fang, X.; Yuan, F.","Objective Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents, often accompanied by motor function disorders. Sarcopenia not only has skeletal muscle dysfunction but also has neurocognitive dysfunction. At present, there is no research to explore the relationship between ADHD and skeletal muscle function. The purpose of this study is to explore whether there is a causal effect between ADHD and sarcopenia. Methods In this study, genome-wide association study data of ADHD, appendicular lean mass (ALM), hand grip strength, and walking pace (WP) were extracted from public databases. The bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method was employed to investigate the correlation between ADHD and sarcopenia-related indicators, and the inverse-variance weighted analysis as the primary analysis method. Results Based on the forward MR analysis, a potential causal relationship exists between ADHD and ALM (odds ratio [OR]=1.020, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012–1.029, p<0.001). The reverse MR analysis indicates a link between WP and the risk of ADHD (OR= 2.712, 95% CI: 1.609–4.571, p<0.001), with an accelerated WP increasing the likelihood of ADHD. Nevertheless, other MR analysis results did not show significant differences. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate an intricate causal relationship between ADHD and sarcopenia, suggesting the absence of a clear link. WP may be used as one of the indicators to evaluate the risk of ADHD. At the same time, we should pay more attention to the ALM of ADHD patients.",2025,,Psychiatry Investigation,22,3,304-310,,10.30773/pi.2024.0290,,#1616,Zhao 2025,"",""
Longitudinal analysis of lifetime stressors and depression: Exploring intersectionality and tailoring social support for better mental health in a community population cohort,"Meng, X.; Li, M.; Su, Y.; Caron, J.; Xiang, Y.-T.","Aims: Health inequalities studies need to understand how individuals simultaneously defined by several socioeconomic factors differ from others when facing a series of stressors across the lifespan in the risk of major depression (MD). Theoretical efforts, as well as empirical studies, have suggested a pertinent role of social support in mental health outcomes. However, little is known about which forms of social support would alleviate the negative impact of MD vulnerability in self-rated mental health (SRMH) across different socioeconomic groups. We investigated 1) differential associations between lifetime stressors and MD across social groups and 2) explored diverse social support forms mediating the associations between MD vulnerability and SRMH. Methods: Data analyzed were from a large longitudinal population-based cohort. Multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy was used to articulate MD vulnerability in different social groups defined by ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Genetic predispositions were also included in the modeling process. These social groups were then regrouped based on their vulnerability level of MD. Mediation analyses were then applied to identify which social support forms mediate the effect of MD vulnerability on SRMH. Results: Higher levels of stressors were associated with higher risks of MD, and their associations varied by different social groups. The social groups (White men with medium SES or White women with high SES) had the lowest predicted incidence of MD, whereas White women with low SES reported the highest predicted incidence of MD. Two social support forms (guidance and opportunity for nurturance) significantly mediated the indirect paths between MD vulnerability and SRMH. Conclusions: By applying an intersectional lens, the present study provides a novel quantitative instrument for documenting the associations of stress and depression in various social identities.

Questioning the role of food addiction in pediatric obesity: Comment on An et al. (2025),"de Oliveira, J.","The study by An et al. (2025) [1] investigated the association between food addiction (FA), obesity, and emotional and behavioral problems in Korean children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. While FA was linked to higher BMI, lower self-esteem, and increased emotional difficulties, critical methodological limitations challenge the clinical relevance of these findings. Cross-sectional designs require careful control of confounding variables, yet essential factors such as genetic predispositions, socioeconomic status, food environment, and family dynamics were not fully addressed. Additionally, behavioral traits like food neophobia, shown by Dos Anjos et al. (2021) [9] to influence unhealthy eating patterns in children, and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, frequently co-occur with disordered eating behaviors and may confound FA classifications. Recent data from Nyholmer et al. (2024) [15] further highlight the overlap between restrictive eating profiles and psychiatric comorbidities, underscoring the need for comprehensive assessment. The study's lack of dietary pattern analysis, particularly concerning ultra-processed food intake, and absence of age-stratified reliability in dietary reporting limit its interpretability. Future research should integrate neurodevelopmental and psychiatric evaluations to clarify whether FA reflects a distinct clinical entity or broader emotional and behavioral dysregulation within pediatric obesity.

Chronic early-life obesity linked to childhood impulsivity predicts long-term psychosis trajectory through dose-dependent cerebellar dysmaturation in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome,"Sandini, C.; Reich, N.; Delavari, F.; Pajic, L.; Escelsior, A.; Forrer, S.; Imparato, A.; Kojovic, N.; Latreche, C.; Parlatini, V.; Cortese, S.; Schneider, M.; Eliez, S.","Background: Recent epidemiological evidence links early-life obesity and metabolic dysregulation to adult psychosis vulnerability, though a causal relationship remains unclear. Establishing causality in highly heritable psychotic disorders requires: 1) demonstrating that early-life metabolic factors mediate between genetic vulnerability and psychosis trajectory, 2) dissecting mechanisms leading to early-life obesity in genetically vulnerable individuals, and 3) clarifying downstream neurodevelopmental pathways linking early-life obesity to psychosis symptoms. Methods: To address these key issues, we investigated bidirectional pathways linking behavioral, BMI, and neurodevelopment trajectories in a unique longitudinal cohort of 184 individuals at high genetic risk for psychosis, due to 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), and 182 neurotypical controls, followed-up since childhood. We combined repeated BMI measurements with clinical/neurocognitive phenotyping and neuroimaging. We investigated the relationship between BMI trajectories with risk of psychosis and tested whether altered cortical or cerebellar development could underlie this association. Results: Childhood behavioral impulsivity predicted early and progressive deviations in BMI trajectories. In turn, pubertal BMI-increases were associated with concomitant worsening of depressive symptoms, while chronic BMI-increases emerging during childhood predicted the subsequent emergence of psychosis during late-adolescence/early-adulthood. The duration of increased BMI-status was associated with emergence of motor and cognitive disorganization, a key schizophrenia symptom domain, which was linked to progressive gray matter volume reductions in posterior-inferior cerebellum. Conclusions: These findings suggest that metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity may link childhood behavioral impulsivity to psychosis vulnerability in 22q11DS, by influencing cerebellar maturation.

Paternal intelligence affects school grades in children with and without ADHD - a register-based study,"Markkula, A.; Igelström, K.; Zhang, H.; Capusan, A.J.","ADHD profoundly impacts educational attainment, quality of life, and health in young adults. However, certain subgroups of ADHD patients seem to do quite well, potentially due to differences in intelligence and socioeconomic status. Here we used paternal intelligence from the Swedish Defence Conscription and Assessment register, to investigate the role of genetic propensity for intelligence, on school performance in a large cohort of ADHD patients and matched controls. Patients treated for ADHD in Linköping, Sweden between 1995 and 2020 (n = 3262), sex- and age-matched controls (n = 9591) as well as their parents and siblings were identified using regional and national registers. Socioeconomic and demographic data, ADHD diagnosis and treatment and school grades at age 16 for the study population were extracted from Swedish National registers. We explored the associations between paternal intelligence and child school performance using linear mixed models and mediation analyses, taking a wide range of potential covariates into account. Results indicate that paternal intelligence was positively associated with standardized school grades in their offspring (Zadjusted=0.09, 95%CI 0.07, 0.10). This effect was present in both ADHD patients and controls, but ADHD patients had significantly lower standardized grades (Zadjusted=-1.03, 95%CI -1.08, -0.98). Child ADHD did not serve as a mediator for how paternal intelligence affected school grades.

Modeling diagnostic code dropout of schizophrenia in electronic health records improves phenotypic data quality and cross-ancestry transferability of polygenic scores,"Burstein, D.; Tomasi, S.; Venkatesh, S.; Rizk, M.; Roussos, P.; Voloudakis, G.","Importance: Researchers commonly use counts of diagnostic codes from EHR-linked biobanks to infer phenotypic status. However, these approaches overlook temporal changes in EHR data, such as the discontinuation or “dropout” of diagnostic codes, which may exacerbate disparities in genomics research, as EHR data quality can be confounded with demographic attributes. Objective: To address this, we propose modeling diagnostic code dropout in EHR data to inform phenotyping for schizophrenia in genomic analyses. Design: We develop and test our diagnostic dropout model by analyzing EHR data from individuals with prior schizophrenia diagnoses. We further validate model performance on a subset of patients whose diagnoses were attained through chart review. Using PRS-CS and existing GWAS summary statistics, we first extrapolate polygenic weights. Then, we apply our dropout model’s outputs to construct a data-driven filter defining our target cohort for measuring polygenic score performance. Setting: Our analysis utilizes EHR and genomic data from the Million Veteran Program. Participants: To model diagnostic dropout in schizophrenia, we leverage data from 12,739 patients with a history of schizophrenia, after excluding outliers. For polygenic score analyses, we incorporate data from a potential pool of 8,385 European ancestry and 6,806 African ancestry patients with a history of schizophrenia. Main outcomes and measures: We compare the performance of our diagnostic dropout model with alternative methodologies both in predicting diagnostic dropout on a holdout set, as well as on chart review labeled data. Using the top differential diagnosis predictors in our model, we select relevant cases by filtering out patients with a prior history of mood or anxiety disorders. We then test the impact of applying different filters for measuring polygenic score performance. Results: When evaluated on chart review-labeled data, our model improves the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 9.6% compared to competing methods. By applying our data-driven filter for schizophrenia, we achieve a 62% increase in the association effect size when transferring a European polygenic score to an African ancestry target cohort.

The Impact of Psychosocial Stress on Quality of Life in Saudi Arabian Patients with Alopecia Areata,"","Brief SummaryBackground: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder that causes non-scaring hair loss, and common psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety are often experienced among these patients. The underlying causes of this disorder, including environmental factors, immune responses, autoimmune reactions, and genetic predisposition, are still debated. This condition affects approximately 0.2% of the global population and has no specific gender preference, with an average onset age of 33 years. This study aims to assess the psychosocial impact on quality of life in individuals with alopecia areata in Saudi Arabia Methodology: This study employed a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among Alopecia areata patients, targeting both Saudi and non-Saudi participants of both genders, from October 2023 - March 2024. The sample size is determined to be 384 participants based on a confidence level of 95%. By investigating the psychological impact of AA in Saudi Arabia.Detailed DescriptionIntroduction: Hair loss is the main symptom of Alopecia areata (AA), which is caused by an autoimmune process. The pathophysiology of this disease is frequently debated; the most prevalent topics are factors related to the environment, non-specific immune responses, organ-specific autoimmune reactions, and genetic background. Furthermore, psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, social phobia, and personality problems are very common among AA patients. Alopecia areata, which affects 0.2% of people globally, causes non-scarring hair loss. There is no obvious gender preference, and the typical age of onset is 33 years. Unpredictability exists in the disease's progression. 34-50% of patients will demonstrate spontaneous recovery 1 year after the disease's beginning, according to earlier research. According to other research, up to 80% of patients would make a full recovery after a year; however, 15-25% of patients would lose all of their body and/or head hair, and fewer than 10% of these patients would make a full recovery. Patients with dermatological conditions are far more likely to have psychiatric diseases. It has been estimated that 25% to 43% of patients visiting dermatological clinics have psychological illnesses. Studies have indicated that people with alopecia are more likely to experience psychological disorders throughout their lifespan, such as severe depression (39%) and generalized anxiety disorder (39%). Looking at the literature, research done in Makkah revealed that a considerable 79.6% of participants said that AA had a detrimental impact on one's psychological well-being. Anxiety (47.9%), depression (36.0%), and feeling criticized in front of others (63.0%) were the most prevalent psychological effects of AA. Furthermore, a study by "" Abideen F"" showed that in 70% of cases, the quality of life measured by the DLQI score was affected, and a history of stress was associated with 28 of the 60 patients with AA, and 17 of them suffered from psychiatric illness. Another study was done by Suchana et al (2020), aimed to investigate depression and anxiety in patients with alopecia areata, According to the study's results, anxiety and depression were both common in 75 individuals, with respective prevalence rates of 66.7% and 73.3%. Due to insignificant number of published studies that focus on the psychosocial impact of alopecia areata among patients in Saudi Arabia, Consequently, exploring this area of study is highly recommended. This study aims to assess the psychosocial impact on quality of life in individuals with alopecia areata in Saudi Arabia Materials and Methods: Study design: This study was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey, based on a structured questionnaire that was developed by the authors, conducted among Alopecia areata patients in Saudi Arabia. Study setting: Participants, recruitment, and sampling procedure: This study population consisted of Alopecia areata patients in Saudi Arabia of both genders from October 2023 - March 2024. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria: Saudi and non-Saudi patients with Alopecia areata in Saudi Arabia who were at least 16 years old, of both sexes, and with all clinical forms of AA met the inclusion criteria. Patients who are below 16 years old and who were ineligible due to medical reasons, and those who had any concomitant chronic dermatological problems, were excluded. Sample size: Using the Raosoft calculator, a sample size of 384 was estimated with a confidence level of 95%. The size of the sample was calculated by using formula: n= P (1-P) \* Zα 2 / d 2with a 95 % confidence level. n: Calculated sample size Z: The z-value for the selected level of confidence (1- a) = 1.96. P: An estimated prevalence of knowledge Q: (1 - 0.50) = 50%, i.e., 0.50 D: The maximum acceptable error = 0.05. So, the calculated minimum sample size was: n = (1.96)2 X 0.50 X 0.50/ (0.05) 2 = 384. Method for data collection and instrument (Data collection Technique and tools): A structured questionnaire was used as a study tool. This questionnaire was developed from previous studies on the same topic, with permission obtained from the authors. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions divided into four sections. Section 1 focused on socio-demographic characteristics and consisted of 9 questions. Section 2 assessed disease diagnosis and management approaches with 6 questions. Section 3 evaluated the psychological impact of the patients with 5 questions. Section 4 examined the quality of life of the patients with 5 questions. In Section 1, participants were asked about their gender, age, nationality, place of residence, educational level, social status, family history of alopecia areata, sources of knowledge about alopecia areata, and type of alopecia they have. Section 2 included questions about when the disease was diagnosed, the onset of the disease, the method of diagnosis, referral to a dermatology clinic, and methods used to treat alopecia areata. Section 3 consisted of Yes/No questions and one multiple-choice question to assess the patient's feelings. Finally, Section 4 contained questions to assess the impact of alopecia areata on the patient's daily activities, such as work/school attendance, shopping habits, gardening activities, or home maintenance. Scoring system: The authors have created a scoring system for analysis of participants response. In our survey, participants were asked about Psychosocial Stress on Quality of Life in Individuals with Alopecia areata. Each question had four valid answers. Each answer had its respective score, ""Never 0, sometimes=1, usually=2, always=3"". The cumulative score of the response was used to classify the participant into a risk category, ""Low risk =1-6, Moderate risk =7-9, High risk =10-12"". The validated questionnaire, which was collected from a number of identical research studies and shown in the appendix, was used to evaluate Psychosocial Stress on Quality of Life in Individuals with Alopecia areata as our methodology describes. Analyzes and entry method: Data was entered on the computer using the ""Microsoft Office Excel Software"" program (2016) for windows. Data was then transferred to the Statistical Package of Social Science Software (SPSS) program, version 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0.

"Association between serum oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory indicators and suicide attempts in adolescents with major depressive disorder","Peng, C.; Xu, M.; Ye, M.; Yang, W.; Fang, M.","Background: Progress in research on the neurobiology of suicide behavior in adolescents has notably lagged compared to that of adults. This study aimed to investigate the associations between serum indicators, including oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory indicators, and psychological factors with suicide attempts (SA) in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) while also exploring potential markers. Methods: This study involved the psychological assessment of 106 first-time hospitalized adolescents aged 12 to 18 with MDD and the measurement of serum indicators. Participants were categorized into two groups according to their history of SA within the preceding six months. Screening the best markers for suicide by machine learning algorithms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the correlation between these indicators and suicide. Secondly, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to initially explore the causal relationship between these serum indicators and suicide. Results: In adolescents diagnosed with MDD, those who had attempted suicide exhibited elevated serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels, more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, increased exposure to adverse life events, less effective coping strategies, worse parental attachment, more severe alexithymia, and more impulsivity when compared to their counterparts without a history of SA (all p<0.05). The multivariable analyses showed a significant association between serum SOD activity (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.043-1.534) and anxiety symptoms (OR 1.056, 95% CI 1.020-1.097) with SA in adolescents diagnosed with MDD. The MR analyses showed a causal association between genetically determined low uric acid (UA) levels and a higher risk of SA (OR 0.942 95%CI 0.896-0.991).

Neurobiological contributions to addiction: a narrative review of adolescent and adult vulnerabilities,"Singh, A.; Ali, A.; Paul, F.A.","Background: Addiction is a multidimensional disorder largely influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors, presenting distinct manifestations in adolescents and adults. At different stages of brain development, neurobiological mechanisms play a central role in the development and persistence of addictive behaviors. Objectives: This review synthesizes recent studies indexed in Scopus, focusing on biological contributions to addiction in adolescents and adults. Materials and methods: The Scopus database was systematically searched and retrieved studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. The overall neurobiological factors that determine vulnerability to addiction among both adolescents and adults were analyzed; these include neurodevelopmental factors, neuroadaptive changes through chronic substance use, and genetic influences. Results: The findings indicate that adolescents, with heightened dopaminergic activity and synaptic plasticity, are particularly sensitive to addictive behaviors, while adults, after prolonged substance use, experience neuroadaptations leading to tolerance and dependence. Genetic predispositions and epigenetic changes also contribute to addiction vulnerability in both groups. These insights suggest the need for targeted prevention and treatment strategies that address the unique neurobiological profiles of adolescents and adults to reduce the overall impact of addiction.

Neurodevelopmental disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks,"Chen, L.; Li, Z.; Fan, Y.","Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence. Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions between genetic susceptibility (Shank3 mutations in ASD), environmental triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine (GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation. Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy, while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial community (increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",2025,,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,15,"(Chen L.; Li Z.; Fan Y., fanyy@sj-hospital.org) Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China",,,10.3389/fcimb.2025.1601888,,#1647,Chen 2025,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Patients with mood disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD), also show elevated cardiovascular risk and inflammatory markers, suggesting shared biological pathways between mood and cardiometabolic conditions. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway, activated by inflammatory cytokines and involved in neurotransmitter systems linked to mood, provides a promising area to explore inflammatory-related genetic overlaps in these disorders, with increasing interest in the SH2B3 rs3184504 SNP. Imaging markers like white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and white matter (WM) microstructure alterations are associated with mood and cardiovascular disorders. This study aimed to investigate the genetic load link to KYN levels, such as KYN polygenic risk score (PRS) and its effect on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), outcomes of presumed vascular suffering, and WM microstructure in a sample of 95 MDD and 80 BD patients. Higher PRS for KYN was associated with increased circulating KYN levels and KYN/TRP ratio. KYN PRS predicted the presence of WMHs. The SH2B3 rs3184504 T variant was associated with increased PRS for KYN and a higher number of WMHs. KYN levels and KYN/TRP ratio were not associated with WMHs, while KYN PRS positively correlated with higher axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD), with a nominal significance for radial diffusivity (RD).

The Efficacy of Stellate Ganglion Block Versus Combined Oral Anticholinergic and Antidepressant Drugs on Treatment of Palmar Hyperhidrosis; A Randomized Comparative Study,"","Brief SummaryThe aim of the study is to compare between ganglion block versus combined oral anticholinergic and antidepressant drugs on treatment of palmar hyperhidrosisDetailed DescriptionPalmar hyperhidrosis is a medical condition characterized by excessive sweating specifically from the palms of the hands. This condition can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, leading to social embarrassment, anxiety, and difficulties in daily activities. It is classified as a type of primary hyperhidrosis, which means it occurs without an identifiable underlying medical cause (Solish et al., 2022). The prevalence of palmar hyperhidrosis is estimated to affect about 1% to 3% of the population. Symptoms typically begin in childhood or adolescence, often becoming more pronounced during periods of hormonal changes such as puberty. The condition may run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition (Wadhawa et al., 2019). The underlying mechanism involves hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, particularly affecting the eccrine sweat glands located in the palms (Kisielnicka et al., 2022). Unlike normal sweating, which primarily serves thermoregulation (cooling the body), palmar hyperhidrosis is triggered by emotional stimuli such as stress or anxiety rather than heat. This inappropriate activation leads to excessive sweating that can occur even at rest (Schote et al., 2022). Diagnosis is primarily clinical and based on patient history and visible signs of excessive sweating. Patients often report episodes that are bilateral and symmetrical, with cold and wet palms that may appear pale or blushed. The diagnosis does not typically require extensive testing unless secondary causes are suspected (Henning et al., 2021). Treatment for palmar hyperhidrosis can be challenging due to varying degrees of severity and individual responses to therapies (Chudry, 2022). Common treatment options include topical treatments as aluminum chloride hexahydrate which is considered one of the most effective topical treatments for palmar hyperhidrosis. It works by blocking sweat pores and reducing gland activity. Application involves using a concentrated solution on dry skin at night until symptoms improve, followed by maintenance therapy (Rahim et al., 2022). Another option of treatment is iontophoresis; this technique uses electrical currents to temporarily block sweat gland function. It requires multiple sessions but can be effective for many patients (Nastase et al., 2024). Botulinum toxin type A can be injected into affected areas to inhibit neurotransmitter release responsible for activating sweat glands. While effective, this treatment requires repeated injections every few months due to its temporary effects (Martina et al., 2021). Anticholinergic drugs have been used but are often limited by side effects such as dry mouth and constipation at effective dosages (Wong et al., 2022). The stellate ganglion block (SGB) is a nonsurgical treatment option for managing hyperhidrosis, particularly in cases where other treatments have failed. The stellate ganglion is a collection of nerves located in the neck that plays a crucial role in regulating sweat gland activity. By blocking these nerves, it is possible to reduce sweating in the affected areas (Deng et al., 2023). The SGB works by injecting local anesthetics into the stellate ganglion, which interrupts the sympathetic nerve signals responsible for activating sweat glands. This procedure can be performed using ultrasound guidance to ensure accurate placement of the needle. The typical approach involves administering an anesthetic such as lidocaine or bupivacaine directly into the ganglion (Feigin et al., 2023). Regarding surgical options; surgical sympathectomy is considered a last resort for severe cases where other treatments have failed. This procedure involves cutting nerves that trigger sweating but carries risks such as compensatory sweating in other body areas (Kuijpers et al., 2022). Finally, palmar hyperhidrosis is a common yet often underreported condition that can severely affect individuals' lives due to its social implications and discomfort associated with excessive sweating. Treatment options vary widely in effectiveness and side effects, necessitating a tailored approach based on individual needs (Trettin et al., 2022).",2024,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#1661,,"",""
Exploring genetic confounding of the associations between excessive screen time and depressive symptoms in adolescence and early adulthood,"Xu, J.; Baldwin, J.; Hughes, A.; Herbert, A.; Munafo, M.R.; Howe, L.D.","Background Digital devices have become a major aspect of children's life. Associations between screen time and mental health have been observed, but the causality remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations between excessive screen time and later depressive symptoms, and to test the robustness of these associations when accounting for genetic confounding. Methods This study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective cohort of children born between 1991 and 1992 in the UK. Different forms of screen time and depressive symptoms at ages 16, 22 and 26 were assessed through self-completion questionnaires. Screen time > 2 hours per day was defined as excessive. Depressive symptoms at age 26 were measured using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). Polygenic scores for mental health problems were calculated. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations between screen time at ages 16, 22 and 26 and depressive symptoms at age 26, adjusting for sociodemographic confounders and polygenic scores. Genetic sensitivity analysis (Gsens) was used to test for genetic confounding in these associations. Results A total of 3,005 participants were included in analysis. Some, but not all, forms of excessive screen time were associated with higher SMFQ scores, e.g. more than 2 hours of television time per day at age 16 (β: 0.07 [95%CI 0.04, 0.11] for weekdays; β: 0.06 [0.02, 0.09] for weekends) and more than 2 hours of gaming time at age 22 (β: 0.07 [95%CI 0.03, 0.10] for weekdays; β: 0.07 [0.04, 0.11] for weekends). These associations persisted after adjusting for sociodemographic confounders and polygenic scores but were attenuated to the null in the genetic sensitivity analysis (β=0.02 [-0.02, 0.06] for the association with >2 hours of television time at age 16 on weekdays; β=-0.01 [-0.05, 0.03]) for >2 hours of gaming time at age 22 on weekdays).

Age at onset as an index of genetic heterogeneity in major psychiatric and substance use disorders,"Kendler, K.S.; Henrik, O.; Sundquist, J.; Sundquist, K.","BACKGROUND: Robust clinical indices of etiologic heterogeneity for psychiatric disorders are rare. We investigate whether age at onset (AAO) reflects genetic heterogeneity, utilizing Genetic Risk Ratios (GRR) derived from Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS). METHODS: We examined, in individuals born in Sweden 1940-2003, whether AAO for five primary disorders -- drug use disorder (DUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ)-- was associated with varying levels of GRRs with a range of informative secondary disorders and traits. RESULTS: Our disorders displayed a varying pattern of change of GRRs with increasing AAO. At one end was SZ, where all GRRs rose with increasing AAO meaning that SZ became increasing genetically heterogeneous with later AAO. The most balanced disorder was AUD where, with increasing AAO, GRRs rose for AD, BD, and MD and declined for DUD, CB, and ADHD. That is, at young AAO, AUD had high levels of genetic risk for other externalizing disorders while at older AAO, high genetic risk for internalizing disorders were more prominent. MD was at the continuum's other end where all GRRs, except for AD, decreased with higher AAO, meaning that MD became increasingly genetically homogeneous with later AAO. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic heterogeneity was robustly associated with AAO across our five primary disorders with substantial inter-disorder differences in the observed patterns. In particular, young AAO was associated with maximal genetic homogeneity for SZ and DUD while older AAO had greater genetic homogeneity for MD with AUD falling in between.",2024,,Psychological medicine,,"(Kendler K.S.)

Using an epigenome-wide approach, we aimed to investigate DNA methylation changes occurring secondary to psychotropic treatment and evaluate associations between 1-month metabolic changes and both baseline and 1-month changes in DNA methylation levels. Seventy-nine patients starting a weight gain inducing psychotropic treatment were selected from the PsyMetab study cohort. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured at baseline and after 1 month of treatment, using the Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Results: A global methylation increase was noted after the first month of treatment, which was more pronounced (p < 2.2 × 10–16) in patients whose weight remained stable (< 2.5% weight increase). Epigenome-wide significant methylation changes (p < 9 × 10−8) were observed at 52 loci in the whole cohort. When restricting the analysis to patients who underwent important early weight gain (≥ 5% weight increase), one locus (cg12209987) showed a significant increase in methylation levels (p = 3.8 × 10–8), which was also associated with increased weight gain in the whole cohort (p = 0.004). Epigenome-wide association analyses failed to identify a significant link between metabolic changes and methylation data. Nevertheless, among the strongest associations, a potential causal effect of the baseline methylation level of cg11622362 on glycemia was revealed by a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (n = 3841 for instrument-exposure association; n = 314,916 for instrument-outcome association).

The perceived social support of parents having bipolar disorder impacts their children’s mental health: a 10-year longitudinal study,"Trespalacios, F.; Boyle, A.; Serravalle, L.; Hodgins, S.; Ellenbogen, M.A.","Background: The offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD) are at higher risk of developing psychopathology than the offspring of parents with no affective disorder (control). In addition to genetic predisposition, childhood adversity and a stressful family environment are important risk factors for the OBD. Protective factors in parents, such as social support and coping strategies, may buffer the effects of stress on at-risk children. This study tested whether parents’ social support and coping style attenuated the link between risk status (OBD vs. control) and psychopathology in offspring. Methods: During offspring’s middle childhood, parents underwent a diagnostic interview and completed social support and coping style questionnaires. Sixty-nine OBD (39 female) and 69 control (29 female) offspring between ages 13 and 29 completed a diagnostic interview approximately 10 years later. Results: Parents’ social support satisfaction moderated the link between offspring risk status and their development of substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms (F(1,131) = 5.90, p =.017). Parents’ social network size moderated the link between offspring risk status and their development of anxiety and depression symptoms in an unexpected direction (F(1,131) = 5.07, p =.026).

"Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome in a 13-year-old girl with autistic spectrum disorder, dysmorphism, a right solitary kidney, and polycystic ovaries: a case report","Al-Enezi, E.; Alghamdi, M.; Al-Enezi, K.; AlBalwi, M.; Davies, W.; Eyaid, W.","Background: Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome was officially documented in 2014. Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome is an extremely rare complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by reduced intellectual capacity, motor dysfunction, facial dysmorphism, impaired development, and an increased predisposition to autism spectrum disorder. In addition, many patients also present with neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and various behavioral abnormalities. Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome is challenging to identify solely on the basis of symptoms, and genetic investigations, including exome sequencing, may facilitate diagnosis. Case presentation: We report a case of 13-year-old Saudi patient who presented with dysmorphic features as illustrated in Fig. 1, severe mental retardation, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Initial genetic testing was unremarkable; thus, a clinical exome analysis was performed to identify the genetic basis of the condition. Conclusions: Clinical exome analysis indicated an autosomal dominant Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome with a likely pathogenic de novo variant within the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox (ADNP) gene not previously reported in Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. The patient had a right-sided solitary kidney and polycystic ovaries, conditions that were not previously associated with HVDAS.",2024,,Journal of Medical Case Reports ,18,1,,,10.1186/s13256-024-04746-2,,#1672,Al-Enezi 2024,"",""
Unidentified CYP2D6 genotype does not affect pharmacological treatment for patients with first episode psychosis,"De Brabander, E.Y.; van Amelsvoort, T.; van Westrhenen, R.","Background: Research on the pharmacogenetic influence of hepatic CYP450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) on metabolism of drugs for psychosis and associated outcome has been inconclusive. Some results suggest increased risk of adverse reactions in poor and intermediate metabolizers, while others find no relationship. However, retrospective designs may fail to account for the long-term pharmacological treatment of patients. Previous studies found that clinicians adapted risperidone dose successfully without knowledge of patient CYP2D6 phenotype. Aim: Here, we aimed to replicate the results of those studies in a Dutch cohort of patients with psychosis (N = 418) on pharmacological treatment. Method: We compared chlorpromazine-equivalent dose between CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes and investigated which factors were associated with dosage. This was repeated in two smaller subsets; patients prescribed pharmacogenetics-actionable drugs according to published guidelines, and risperidone-only as done previously. Results: We found no relationship between chlorpromazine-equivalent dose and phenotype in any sample (complete sample: p = 0.3, actionable-subset: p = 0.82, risperidone-only: p = 0.34). Only clozapine dose was weakly associated with CYP2D6 phenotype (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Clinicians were thus not intuitively adapting dose to CYP2D6 activity in this sample, nor was CYP2D6 activity associated with prescribed dose. Although the previous studies could not be replicated, this study may provide support for existing and future pharmacogenetic research.",2024,,Journal of Psychopharmacology,38,12,1111-1121,,10.1177/02698811241279022,,#1674,DeBrabander 2024,"",""
Gut microbial and human genetic signatures of inflammatory bowel disease increase risk of comorbid mental disorders,"Lee, J.; Oh, S.J.; Ha, E.; Shin, G.Y.; Kim, H.J.; Kim, K.; Lee, C.K.","The high prevalence of comorbid mental disorders (CMDs) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well-documented. This study delves into the intricate CMD-IBD relationship through comprehensive analyses using human variants, gut microbiome, and anxiety/depression estimates from a cohort of 507 IBD patients and 75 controls. Notably, patients with IBD, especially those with CMD, exhibited lower diversity than controls. We identified 106 differentially abundant taxa (DATs) in IBD patients compared to controls and 21 DATs distinguishing CMD-affected from CMD-free IBD patients. Microbial IBD-risk scores, reflecting an individual’s microbial burden for IBD, revealed a significant enrichment of IBD-risk signatures in CMD-affected patients compared to CMD-free patients. Additionally, there was an IBD-risk variant potentially regulating the abundance of an IBD/CMD-associated DAT, suggesting an interplay between IBD-risk variants and dysbiosis in CMD. Our investigation underscores the pivotal role of IBD-associated gut dysbiosis in predisposing IBD patients to CMD, partially through genetic variant-mediated mechanisms.",2024,,npj Genomic Medicine,9,1,,,10.1038/s41525-024-00440-w,,#1675,Lee 2024,"",""

Moreover, it is frequently accompanied by bipolar disorder (BD) as well as borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is unclear whether these disorders share underlying pathomechanisms, given that all three are characterized by alterations in affective states, either long or short-term. BD is characterized by infrequent but intense mood shifts, while ADHD and BPD involve more dynamic emotional fluctuations. It is yet to be determined whether these disorders represent distinct phenomena or different points on a spectrum of affective dysregulation. Methods: This study seeks to distinguish the emotional dysregulation of BPD, ADHD, and BD by using digital phenotyping, a measurement burst electronic-diary method with different sampling rates, and accelerometry to measure participants’ activity. Our study will include 480 participants aged 14 to 50 (120 each from BPD, ADHD, BD, and healthy control groups) from five European sites. Participants’ smartphones will provide continuous data on their digital phenotypes, i.e., by indicators of physical activity and communication, for one year, along with daily evening ratings of mood and sleep. Moreover, five intensive measurement periods of five days each, called measurement bursts, will occur throughout the year, with electronic diaries asking participants to report on mood, self-esteem, impulsivity, life events, social interactions, and dysfunctional behaviors ten times a day. Moreover, participants will wear activity sensors during the five measurement bursts. Statistical analysis aims to identify whether affective dysregulation aspects share or differ across disorders. Specifically, data analysis aims to investigate the differences in parameters of affect fluctuation such as attractor strength and variability between disorders and to test the association of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders and resilience factors with critical parameters of affect modulation. Discussion: The results of this study offer the potential to link patients’ external exposures with their affective state, reduce misdiagnosis, and determine the best timing for therapeutic interventions. Potential limitations of the study include insufficient recruitment of patients and drop-outs due to various protocol violations.

Here, we use a prospective birth cohort study to investigate whether common variant genetic liability for a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions are associated with paediatric incontinence and constipation. We used data from 7,857 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) with data on genotype, incontinence, and constipation, and calculated Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for neurodevelopmental traits (ADHD, autism, intelligence) and psychiatric conditions (anxiety, depression, and OCD). Incontinence subtypes (daytime urinary incontinence [DUI], enuresis [any bedwetting and enuresis subtypes: monosymptomatic, non-monosymptomatic], faecal incontinence), and constipation, were assessed by parental reports at age 9 years and self-reports at age 14.

Polygenic Risk for Substance Use Disorders as Predictors of Substance Use Initiation Among African American Youth,"Sosnowski, D.W.; Rabinowitz, J.A.; Feder, K.A.; Strickland, J.C.; Hancock, D.B.; Uhl, G.R.; Ialongo, N.S.; Maher, B.S.","OBJECTIVE: Despite adverse health consequences associated with early substance use initiation, less is known about the influence of genetic risk on initiation and environmental characteristics that may moderate these associations, particularly among African Americans. We examined whether genetic risk for alcohol and cannabis use disorder, and nicotine dependence, is associated with age of initiation of these substances, and whether community disadvantage and parental monitoring moderate these associations in a sample of African American youth. METHOD: Participants (n=1,017; 56% female) were initially recruited for an elementary school-based universal prevention intervention trial. At age ~20, participants reported on age of initiation of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and provided a saliva or blood sample. At age ~12, caregiver reports on parental monitoring were obtained, along with census-tract data to measure community disadvantage. Hypotheses were tested using Cox Proportional Hazard Models. RESULTS: Higher alcohol use disorder PRS was associated with later alcohol initiation (HR=0.78, 95% CI =0.65-0.94). Cannabis use disorder and nicotine dependence PRSs were not associated with initiation of these substances. We observed an interaction between the cannabis use disorder PRS and parental monitoring; among individuals with high cannabis use disorder PRS, high monitoring was associated with earlier cannabis initiation, whereas among individuals with low PRS, low monitoring was associated with earlier initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings largely indicate that PRS for substance use disorders are not associated with age of initiation among African American youth.

Cases with 16p11.2 duplication syndrome have similar neurodevelopmental problems, but typically show a partial ‘mirror phenotype’ with underweight and microcephaly. Various copy number variants (CNVs) of the chromosomal 16p11.2 region have been described. Most is known about the ‘typical’ 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 (29.6–30.2 Mb; ~600 kb) deletions and duplications, but there are also several published cohorts with more distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (28.8–29.0 Mb; ~220 kb), who exhibit clinical overlap. We assessed 100 cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and compared their clinical characteristics to provide more clear genotype-phenotype correlations and raise awareness of the different 16p11.2 CNVs. Neurodevelopmental and weight issues were reported in the majority of cases. Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion showed the most severe obesity phenotype (73.7% obesity, mean BMI SDS 3.2). In addition to the more well defined typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs, we describe the clinical features of five cases with other, overlapping, 16p11.2 CNVs in more detail.

This systematic review of case reports and case series aimed to characterize the demographic, social, and clinical factors associated with isoniazid-induced psychosis in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) and those who received isoniazid for latent TB infection (LTBI). Methods: We comprehensively searched the Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases to identify relevant studies published between the date of inception of the database and June 2024. Results: A total of 28 studies, including 21 case reports and 7 case series involved 37 patients who developed isoniazid-induced psychosis. A higher frequency of isoniazid-induced psychosis was observed during the first 2 months of treatment, with a relatively early onset observed among patients aged 18 years or less. Delusions and/or hallucinations are the common symptoms of isoniazid-induced psychosis. Psychomotor disturbances, disorganized speech or formal thought disorder, disorganized or abnormal behaviour, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (sleep disturbances, hostility or aggression, confusion, affective symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and cognitive difficulties) were the other symptoms observed in the included studies. More than 80% of cases rechallenged with isoniazid resulted in the recurrence of psychotic symptoms. Conclusion: Patients with TB and LTBI should be assessed for psychotic and neuropsychiatric symptoms during isoniazid therapy, mainly in the first 2 months.

Genetic Determinants of Bone Microarchitecture and its Association with Health Outcomes: A Genome-wide Association and Mendelian Randomization Study on Trabecular Bone Score,"Guo, S.; Zhang, J.; Li, H.; Lin, G.N.; Cheng, C.-K.","Background Bone microarchitecture is a critical determinant of bone strength and fracture risk, yet its genetic basis and relationship to systemic health remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to identify genetic determinants of bone microarchitecture using trabecular bone score (TBS) and investigate the causal relationships between bone microarchitecture and various health outcomes. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TBS in 25,268 UK Biobank participants to identify genetic loci associated with bone microarchitecture. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess the causal relationships between systemic health risk factors and bone microarchitecture, as well as the impact of bone microarchitecture on musculoskeletal disorders. Findings The GWAS identified 75 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 19 genomic loci, with an estimated heritability of TBS at 24.5%. Many of these loci (18/19) were also associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures, indicating a shared genetic basis for bone microarchitecture and bone mass. MR analysis revealed that rheumatoid arthritis has a significant causal effect on the deterioration of bone microarchitecture (β = -0.003, P = 1.14×10-4). Suggestive associations were found between bone microarchitecture deterioration and inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, and depression (P < 0.05). Moreover, genetically predicted TBS was significantly associated with fracture risk (OR = 0.003, P = 1.89×10-8) and suggestively associated with osteonecrosis (OR = 0.002, P = 0.040). Interpretation This study identified novel genetic determinants of bone microarchitecture and demonstrated its association with various systemic diseases, highlighting the critical role of bone microarchitecture in skeletal health. The results advocate for the clinical use of TBS to better assess the risk of osteoporosis and fractures and to improve bone and overall health assessments. The causal effect of rheumatoid arthritis on microarchitectural deterioration underscores the need for increased monitoring of bone health in this population.

However, robust and replicable functional brain signatures of 22q11.2DS and 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis remain elusive due to small sample sizes and a focus on small single-site cohorts. Here, we identify functional brain signatures of 22q11.2DS and 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis, and their links with idiopathic early psychosis, using one of the largest multi-cohort data to date. We obtained multi-cohort clinical phenotypic and task-free fMRI data from 856 participants (101 22q11.2DS, 120 idiopathic early psychosis, 101 idiopathic autism, 123 idiopathic ADHD, and 411 healthy controls) in a case-control design. A novel spatiotemporal deep neural network (stDNN)-based analysis was applied to the multi-cohort data to identify functional brain signatures of 22q11.2DS and 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis. Next, stDNN was used to test the hypothesis that the functional brain signatures of 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis overlap with idiopathic early psychosis but not with autism and ADHD. stDNN-derived brain signatures distinguished 22q11.2DS from controls, and 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis with very high accuracies (86–94%) in the primary cohort and two fully independent cohorts without additional training. Robust distinguishing features of 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis emerged in the anterior insula node of the salience network and the striatum node of the dopaminergic reward pathway. These features also distinguished individuals with idiopathic early psychosis from controls, but not idiopathic autism or ADHD. Our results reveal that individuals with 22q11.2DS exhibit a highly distinct functional brain organization compared to controls. Additionally, the brain signatures of 22q11.2DS-associated psychosis overlap with those of idiopathic early psychosis in the salience network and dopaminergic reward pathway, providing substantial empirical support for the theoretical aberrant salience-based model of psychosis.

Social media and youth mental health: Simple narratives produce biased interpretations.,"Sewall, C.J.R.; Parry, D.A.","Many academics and pundits contend that social media use is the primary cause of an international youth mental health crisis. However, these claims often rely on correlational evidence, ignoring the confounding effects of developmental, environmental, social, and psychological factors that influence mental health. This oversimplifies the complex etiology of mental health problems. We call for a more nuanced understanding of the role of social media in youth mental health that avoids oversimplification. Additionally, we urge researchers to move beyond vague, narrative-driven verbal theories and encode them into precise, testable causal models. Using simulation techniques and specification curve analyses, we show how misspecified models that ignore these confounding factors can lead to biased conclusions about social media’s adverse effects. This simplistic focus on social media use diverts attention from the broader factors contributing to youth mental health problems, hindering the development of effective interventions and support. This article highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how social media impacts youth mental health. It shows that focusing solely on social media as the primary cause of mental health problems can lead to biased conclusions and overlook other significant factors.

To characterize the genetic underpinnings of OCS and its genetic relationship to OCD, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported OCS to date (N = 33,943 with complete phenotypic and genome-wide data), combining the results from seven large-scale population-based cohorts from Sweden, the Netherlands, England, and Canada (including six twin cohorts and one cohort of unrelated individuals). We found no genome-wide significant associations at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or gene-level, but a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on the OCD GWAS previously published by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC-OCD) was significantly associated with OCS (Pfixed = 3.06 × 10−5). Also, one curated gene set (Mootha Gluconeogenesis) reached Bonferroni-corrected significance (Ngenes = 28, Beta = 0.79, SE = 0.16, Pbon = 0.008). Expression of genes in this set is high at sites of insulin mediated glucose disposal. Dysregulated insulin signaling in the etiology of OCS has been suggested by a previous study describing a genetic overlap of OCS with insulin signaling-related traits in children and adolescents. We report a SNP heritability of 4.1% (P = 0.0044) in the meta-analyzed GWAS, and heritability estimates based on the twin cohorts of 33–43%.

Clinical segmentation in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: Cognitive impairments and additional genetic load,"Schmock, H.; Stevenson, M.P.; Hanebaum, S.; Vangkilde, A.; Rosengren, A.; Weinsheimer, S.M.; Skovby, F.; Olesen, C.; Ullum, H.; Baaré, W.F.C.; Siebner, H.R.; Didriksen, M.; Werge, T.; Olsen, L.; Jepsen, J.R.M.","The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is associated with high psychiatric morbidity. However, large phenotypic heterogeneity hampers early detection of 22q11.2DS individuals at highest risk. Here, we investigated whether individuals with 22q11.2DS can be subdivided into clinically relevant subgroups based on their severity of cognitive impairments and whether such subgroups differ in polygenic risk. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined the number of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an unselected nationwide biobank cohort of individuals with 22q11.2DS (n = 183). Approximately 35% of this sample, aged 10–30 years, had a history with one or more psychiatric diagnosis. In a representative nested subgroup of 28 children and youth, we performed additional comprehensive cognitive evaluation and assessed psychiatric symptoms. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to divide the subgroup of 22q11.2DS individuals, based on their performance on the cognitive testing battery. This produced two groups that did not differ in mean age or gender composition, but were characterized by low cognitive (LF) and high cognitive (HF) functional levels. The LF group, which had significantly lower global cognitive functioning scores, also displayed higher negative symptom scores; whereas, the HF group displayed lower rate of current psychiatric disorders than the LF group and the reminder of the biobank cohort. The polygenic risk score for schizophrenia was insignificantly lower for the low functioning group than for the high functioning group, after adjustment.

To what extent is this variation in developmental trajectories associated with age at autism diagnosis? Does the genetic profile of autism vary with age at autism diagnosis? Using longitudinal data from four birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different trajectories of socio-emotional behaviours are associated with age at diagnosis. We further demonstrate that the age at autism diagnosis is partly heritable (h2SNP = 0.12, s.e.m = 0.01), and is associated with two moderately correlated (rg = 0.38, s.e.m = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier diagnosis of autism, lower social and communication abilities in early childhood. The second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis, increased socio-emotional difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, mental health conditions, and trauma. Overall, our research identifies an axis of heterogeneity in autism, indexed by age at diagnosis, which partly explains heterogeneity in autism and the profiles of co-occurring neurodevelopmental and mental health profiles.

We used family designs and T2DM polygenic risk score (T2DM-PRS) to investigate the genetic associations between psychiatric disorders and T2DM. METHODS: We linked 659 906 individuals born in Denmark 1990-2000 to their parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles using population-based registers. We compared rates of T2DM in relatives of children with and without a diagnosis of any or one of 11 specific psychiatric disorders, including neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, using Cox regression. In a genotyped sample (iPSYCH2015) of individuals born 1981-2008 (n = 134 403), we used logistic regression to estimate associations between a T2DM-PRS and these psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Among 5 235 300 relative pairs, relatives of individuals with a psychiatric disorder had an increased risk for T2DM with stronger associations for closer relatives (parents:hazard ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.35-1.42; grandparents: 1.14, 1.13-1.15; and aunts/uncles: 1.19, 1.16-1.22). In the genetic sample, one standard deviation increase in T2DM-PRS was associated with an increased risk for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio = 1.11, 1.08-1.14). Both familial T2DM and T2DM-PRS were significantly associated with seven of 11 psychiatric disorders, most strongly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, and inversely with anorexia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of familial co-aggregation and higher T2DM polygenic liability associated with psychiatric disorders point toward shared familial risk. This suggests that part of the comorbidity is explained by shared familial risks.

Genetic studies have been mostly restricted to European settings, with polygenic scores (PGS) demonstrating low portability across diverse global populations. METHODS: This study examines genetic architecture, polygenic prediction, and socio-environmental correlates of MDD in a family-based sample of 10 032 individuals from Nepal with array genotyping data. We used genome-based restricted maximum likelihood to estimate heritability, applied S-LDXR to estimate the cross-ancestry genetic correlation between Nepalese and European samples, and modeled PGS trained on a GWAS meta-analysis of European and East Asian ancestry samples. RESULTS: We estimated the narrow-sense heritability of lifetime MDD in Nepal to be 0.26 (95% CI 0.18-0.34, p = 8.5 × 10-6). Our analysis was underpowered to estimate the cross-ancestry genetic correlation (rg = 0.26, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.81). MDD risk was associated with higher age (beta = 0.071, 95% CI 0.06-0.08), female sex (beta = 0.160, 95% CI 0.15-0.17), and childhood exposure to potentially traumatic events (beta = 0.050, 95% CI 0.03-0.07), while neither the depression PGS (beta = 0.004, 95% CI -0.004 to 0.01) or its interaction with childhood trauma (beta = 0.007, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03) were strongly associated with MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of lifetime MDD heritability in this Nepalese sample were similar to previous European ancestry samples, but PGS trained on European data did not predict MDD in this sample.

In humans, it is essential for coordinating sensorimotor responses, performing associative/executive functions, and representing information in multiple dimensions. Understanding which genetic variants underpin corpus callosum morphometry, and their shared influence on cortical structure and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, can provide molecular insights into the CC’s role in mediating cortical development and its contribution to neuropsychiatric disease. To characterize the morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum, we developed a publicly available artificial intelligence based tool to extract, parcellate, and calculate its total and regional area and thickness. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), we extracted measures of midsagittal corpus callosum morphometry and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of European participants (combined N = 46,685). We then examined evidence for generalization to the non-European participants of the UKB and ABCD cohorts (combined N = 7,040). Post-GWAS analyses implicate prenatal intracellular organization and cell growth patterns, and high heritability in regions of open chromatin, suggesting transcriptional activity regulation in early development. Results suggest programmed cell death mediated by the immune system drives the thinning of the posterior body and isthmus. Global and local genetic overlap, along with causal genetic liability, between the corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity and bipolar disorders were identified.

Targeting Negative Affect Through Mindfulness Training in Youth at Risk for Internalizing Problems (R33),"","Brief SummaryThe goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the effects of an online mindfulness program to an active supportive comparison condition and a no-intervention control group on reducing and preventing mood and anxiety symptoms in at-risk youth. Youth who are high on trait negative affect will be randomized to one of the three conditions. The primary outcomes of interest are reductions in momentary negative affect and internalizing problems in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years old. All participants will be evaluated prior to being randomized, after the 9-session intervention period, and at a 6-month follow-up. The first hypothesis is that the mindfulness intervention will predict decreases in stressor-reactive momentary negative affect and internalizing symptoms. The second hypothesis is that changes in momentary negative affect will partially account for the effects of the mindfulness intervention on internalizing symptoms.Detailed DescriptionRates of anxiety and depression in youth are substantial, causing a major unmet need for effective prevention and treatment. A salient risk factor for anxiety and depression is negative affectivity - a partially heritable propensity to experience and express more frequent, intense, and enduring aversive emotional states. Prior longitudinal studies have shown that elevated trait negative affectivity (tNA) during mid-adolescence predicted internalizing disorders later in adolescence and early adulthood, and this relation was partially mediated by changes in momentary negative affect (mNA) measured with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The conceptual rationale for this investigation is as follows: Trait negative affectivity (tNA) is a risk factor for internalizing symptoms and disorders. tNA also predicts higher levels of momentary negative affect (mNA), measured with EMA, which in turn partially accounts for the prospective association between tNA and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mindfulness interventions reduce both mNA and internalizing symptoms. Given these empirical relations, this study will test whether in youth with high levels of tNA, an online, coached mindfulness program reduces mNA, as measured with EMA, and whether significantly reducing mNA via a mindfulness intervention then prevents the worsening or onset of internalizing problems. Mindfulness-based interventions have been found to reduce negative affect and internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. This study will evaluate changes in mNA as a transdiagnostic target of mindfulness-based training in youth at high risk (i.e., high tNA) for internalizing problems, and the degree to which reductions in such mNA partially account for the effects of mindfulness training on internalizing outcomes in youth. This randomized controlled prevention trial will test the extent to which youth assigned to an online, coached mindfulness program as compared to youth in a supportive attention comparison intervention and a no-intervention control condition will show reduced mNA and its two components -- stressor-independent and stressor-reactive momentary negative affect. The mindfulness training will be implemented through mobile technology (e.g., online program). Investigating the efficacy of an online mode of delivery of mindfulness with support of a coach can advance the prevention of internalizing psychopathology in a manner that could be disseminated broadly. Such technology would improve access to care for youth who can be easily identified as being vulnerable to internalizing problems due to having high levels of tNA.",2024,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#1719,,"",""
Alcohol use disorder and risk of specific methods of suicide death in a national cohort,"Edwards, A.C.; Abrahamsson, L.; Crump, C.; Sundquist, J.; Sundquist, K.; Kendler, K.S.","Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the strongest correlates of suicide death, but it is unclear whether AUD status is differentially associated with risk of suicide by particular methods. Methods: The authors used competing risks models to evaluate the association between AUD status and risk of suicide by poisoning, suffocation, drowning, firearm, instruments, jumping, or other means in a large Swedish cohort born 1932–1995 (total N = 6,581,827; 48.8% female). Data were derived from Swedish national registers, including the Cause of Death Register and a range of medical registers. Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and familial liability to suicidal behavior, AUD was positively associated with risk of suicide for each method evaluated (cumulative incidence differences: 0.006–1.040 for females, 0.046–0.680 for males), except the association with firearm suicide in females. AUD was most strongly associated with risk of suicide by poisoning. Sex differences in the effects of AUD and family liability were observed for some, but not all, methods. Furthermore, high familial liability for suicidal behavior exacerbated AUD's impact on risk for suicide by poisoning (both sexes) and suffocation and jumping (males only), while the inverse interaction was observed for firearm suicide (males only). Conclusions: AUD increases risk of suicide by all methods examined and is particularly potent with respect to risk of suicide by poisoning. Differences in risk related to sex and familial liability to suicidal behavior underscore AUD's nuanced role in suicide risk.

Genetic propensity to depression and the role of partnership status,"Gueltzow, M.; Lahtinen, H.; Bijlsma, M.J.; Myrskylä, M.; Martikainen, P.","Social relationships and genetic propensity are known to affect depression risk, but their joint effects are poorly understood. This study examined the association of a polygenic index for depression with time to antidepressant (AD) purchasing and the moderating role of partnership status. We analysed data from 30,192 Finnish individuals who participated in the FINRISK and Health 2000 and 2011 surveys and had register and medication data available. We measured genetic risk with a polygenic index (PGI) for depression. Depression was assessed through antidepressant purchases. We estimated an accelerated failure time model with partnership status as time-varying and different sets of confounder adjustments. The predicted cumulative hazard of antidepressant purchasing varied across PGI and partnership status. At follow-up year 10, being widowed was associated with the largest cumulative hazard of 0.34 (95%CI: 0.28–0.39) in the 80th and 0.20 (95%CI: 0.17–0.23) in the 20th PGI percentile, followed by divorced, single, married and cohabiting. Cohabiting was associated with a cumulative hazard of 0.19 (95%CI: 0.16–0.23) in the 80th and 0.11 (95%CI: 0.1–0.13) in the 20th PGI percentile. We found no evidence for an interaction between the PGI and partnership status. Results were robust to different model specifications, gender stratification, and the choice of PGI.

The causal role of male pubertal timing for the development of externalizing and internalizing traits: results from Mendelian randomization studies,"Dinkelbach, L.; Peters, T.; Grasemann, C.; Hinney, A.; Hirtz, R.","Preexisting epidemiological studies suggest that early pubertal development in males is associated with externalizing (e.g., conduct problems, risky behavior, and aggression) and internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) traits and disorders. However, due to problems inherent to observational studies, especially of reverse causation and residual confounding, it remains unclear whether these associations are causal. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies take advantage of the random allocation of genes at conception and can establish causal relationships. In the current study, N=76 independent genetic variants for male puberty timing (MPT) were derived from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 205,354 participants and used as an instrumental variable in MR studies on 17 externalizing and internalizing traits and psychopathologies utilizing outcome GWAS with 16,400 to 1,045,957 participants. In these MR studies, earlier MPT was significantly associated with higher scores for the overarching phenotype of ‘Externalizing Traits’ (beta=-0.03, 95%-CI [-0.06, -0.01]). However, this effect was likely driven by an earlier age at first sex (beta=-0.17, 95%-CI [-0.21, - 0.13]), without evidence for an effect on further externalizing phenotypes. Regarding internalizing phenotypes, earlier MPT was associated with higher levels of the ‘Depressed Affect’ subdomain of neuroticism (beta=-0.04, 95%-CI [-0.07, -0.01]). Late MPT was related to higher scores of internalizing traits in early life (beta=0.04, 95%-CI [0.01, 0.08]). In conclusion, this MR study supports a causal effect of MPT on specific traits and behaviors.

Clarifying the relationship between physical injuries and risk for suicide attempt in a Swedish national sample,"Stephenson, M.; Ohlsson, H.; Lannoy, S.; Sundquist, J.; Sundquist, K.; Edwards, A.C.","Introduction: The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide proposes that capability for suicide is acquired through exposure to painful and provocative events (PPEs). Although there is robust evidence for a positive association between aggregate measures of PPEs and risk for suicidal behavior, little is known about the contributions of physical injuries. The present study investigated the relationship between injuries and risk of subsequent suicide attempt (SA). Methods: Data were from Swedish population-based registers. All individuals born in Sweden between 1970 and 1990 were included (N = 1,011,725 females and 1,067,709 males). We used Cox regression models to test associations between 10 types of injuries (eye injury; fracture; dislocation/sprain/strain; injury to nerves and spinal cord; injury to blood vessels; intracranial injury; crushing injury; internal injury; traumatic amputation; and other or unspecified injuries) and risk for later SA. Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for year of birth and parental education. Additional models tested for differences in the pattern of associations based on age group and genetic liability for SA. In co-relative models, we tested the association between each injury type and risk for SA in relative pairs of varying genetic relatedness to control for unmeasured familial confounders. Results: All 10 injury types were associated with elevated risk for SA (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1.2–7.0). Associations were stronger in the first year following an injury (HRs = 1.8–7.0), but HRs remained above 1 more than 1 year after injury exposure (HRs = 1.2–2.6). The strength of associations varied across injury type, sex, age, and genetic liability for SA. For example, the magnitude of the association between crushing injury and risk for SA was larger in females than males, whereas other injuries showed a similar pattern of associations across sex. Moreover, there was evidence to support positive additive interaction effects between several injury types and aggregate genetic liability for SA (relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI] = 0.1–0.3), but the majority of these interactions became non-significant or changed direction after accounting for comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders. In co-relative models, the pattern of associations differed by injury type, such that there was evidence to support a potential causal effect of eye injury, fracture, dislocation/sprain/strain, intracranial injury, and other and unspecified injuries on risk for SA.

Conclusions: Injuries are associated with increased risk for subsequent SA, particularly in the first year following an injury.

CSMD1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) where emergent functions of the complement pathway modulate neural development and synaptic activity. While a genetic risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, the role of CSMD1 in neurodevelopmental disorders is unclear. Through international variant sharing, we identified inherited biallelic CSMD1 variants in eight individuals from six families of diverse ancestry who present with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and polymicrogyria. We modeled CSMD1 loss-of-function (LOF) pathogenesis in early-stage forebrain organoids differentiated from CSMD1 knockout human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We show that CSMD1 is necessary for neuroepithelial cytoarchitecture and synchronous differentiation.

Association of longitudinal trajectories of general and abdominal adiposity during middle age with mental health and well-being in late life: A prospective analysis,"Qin, H.; Hu, G.; Liang, Z.; Jin, X.; Chen, X.; Su, B.; Bao, Y.; Ouyang, J.; Wang, Y.","Single measures of adiposity markers, such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), are associated with adverse mental health outcomes; however, long-term patterns of adiposity and their health effects remain unclear. The current study assessed adiposity trajectories during a 14-year span beyond middle age and their relevance to mental well-being in late life, and the contribution of genetic and lifestyle factors to the trajectories. Based on a nationally representative sample with longitudinal anthropometric measures, adiposity trajectories were identified by latent mixture modeling, and logistic regression model was used to estimate their associations with mental well-being, with adjustment for confounders. Of the 3491 eligible participants included (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [8.9] years), five discrete BMI and four WC trajectory patterns were identified over 14 years. Compared with the low-stable BMI group (range, 22.8 to 22.9 kg/m²; representing stable healthy body weight), the high-stable group (range, 34.3 to 35.4 kg/m²; stable obese) was associated with increased risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95 % CI, 1.28–2.07) and low subjective well-being (OR, 1.35; 95 % CI, 1.02–1.79). Compared with the low-stable WC group (range, 75 to 79 cm healthy WC), the high-increasing group (range, 114 to 121 cm) was associated with increased risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95 % CI, 1.19–2.25) and low well-being (OR, 1.48; 95 % CI, 1.01–2.16). The adiposity trajectories, especially the high-stable/increasing groups, were driven by genetic factors in a dose-response manner, whereas the high/moderate-increasing groups were also behaviorally related. This longitudinal cohort study reveals that stably high trajectory patterns of central and general adiposity during middle age were associated with higher risk of depression and low well-being in late life.

Method The RISKMet project investigates MetS in individuals treated with SGAs, focusing on both adult and paediatric populations. The study utilizes a case-control design to examine potential risk factors for MetS, categorizing participants as MetS+ considered as “Cases” and MetS- considered as “Controls” matched by sex and age. The evaluation of factors such as MetS, lifestyle habits, and environmental influences is conducted at two time points, T0 and T3, after 3 months. Subsequently, the project aims to assess body parameters, including physical examinations, and blood, and stool sample collection, to evaluate metabolic markers and the impact of SGAs. The analysis includes pharmacological treatment data and genetic variability. Behavioural markers related to lifestyle, eating behaviour, PA, and mood are assessed at both T0 and T3 using interviews, accelerometers, and a mobile app. The study aims to improve mental and physical well-being in SGA-treated individuals, establish a biobank for MetS research, build an evidence base for physical health programs, and develop preventive strategies for SGA-related comorbidities. Conclusions This project innovates MetS monitoring in psychiatry by using intensive digital phenotyping, identifying biochemical markers, assessing familial risks, and including genetically similar healthy controls.",2024,,PLoS ONE,19,5 May,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0298161,,#1740,deGirolamo 2024,"",""

A promising approach to make progress with this conundrum is to parse distinct subtypes of this behaviour. Utilizing 1,624 children with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) and 3,224 healthy controls from the ABCD Study, we clustered children with STB based on thirty-four cognitive and psychopathological measures which capture suicide-related risk-moderating traits. Environmental and genetic risk factors, as well as neuroanatomical characteristics of each subtype, were then compared with controls. We identified five distinct STB subtypes, each revealing unique neuroanatomy, environmental/genetic risks, and persistence patterns. Subtype 1 (Depressive, 9.6%) exhibited the most severe depressive symptoms. Subtype 2 (Externalizing, 20.1%) displayed anatomical and functional alterations in frontoparietal network and increased genetic risk for ADHD. Subtype 3 (Cognitive Deficit, 20.4%) demonstrated lower cognitive performance and widespread white-matter deficits. Subtype 4 (Mild Psychotic, 22.2%) presented higher prodromal psychotic symptoms, often unnoticed by parents. Subtype 5 (High Functioning, 27.6%) showed larger total brain volume, better cognition, and higher socio-economic status, contrasting subtypes 1-4. Only Subtypes 1 and 2 demonstrate persistent STB features at the 2-year follow-up.

Below average trajectories are associated with respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health comorbidities, as well as with premature death. This Review presents progressive research into lung-function trajectories and assists the implementation of this knowledge in clinical practice as an innovative approach to detect poor lung health early, monitor respiratory disease progression, and promote lung health. Specifically, we propose that, similar to paediatric height and weight charts used globally to monitor children's growth, lung-function charts could be used for both children and adults to monitor lung health status across the life course.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder: Evidence From Multiple Genetically Informed Designs,"Garcia-Argibay, M.; Brikell, I.; Thapar, A.; Lichtenstein, P.; Lundström, S.; Demontis, D.; Larsson, H.","Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are two highly prevalent disorders that frequently co-occur. Prior evidence from genetic and cohort studies supports an association between ADHD and MDD. However, the direction and mechanisms underlying their association remain unclear. As onset of ADHD occurs in early life, it has been hypothesized that ADHD may cause MDD. Methods: We examined the association of ADHD with MDD using 3 different genetically informed methods to disentangle causality from confounding: 1) a nationwide longitudinal register-based full sibling comparison (N = 1,018,489) adjusting for shared familial confounding; 2) a prospective co-twin control study comprising 16,477 twins (5084 monozygotic and 11,393 dizygotic); and 3) a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using the largest available ADHD (N = 225,534) and MDD (N = 500,199) genome-wide association study summary statistics, adjusting for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropy. Results: Sibling and twin comparisons indicated that individuals with ADHD have an increased risk for subsequent development of MDD (hazard ratio = 4.12 [95% CI 3.62–4.69]) after adjusting for shared genetic and familial factors and that ADHD scores endorsed by parents are positively associated with subsequent MDD scores at ages 15 and 18 years (b = 0.07 [95% CI 0.05–0.08] and b = 0.09 [95% CI 0.08–0.11], respectively). Mendelian randomization analyses showed that genetic liability for ADHD is causally related to MDD (odds ratio = 1.15 [95% CI 1.08–1.23]).

Methods: A maternal immune activation (MIA) protocol was used by injecting pregnant mice (at E9.5) with a viral mimic poly IC or saline. Then, juvenile/adolescent offspring (3-7 weeks old) were subjected to either standard lighting (12:12LD) or constant light (LL). Results: We found interactions of the two factors on behaviors related to cognition, anxiety, and sociability. Also, poly IC exposure led to a more activated profile of hippocampal microglia in males only, while LL diminished these effects. Using RNA sequencing in the dorsal hippocampus, we found that poly IC exposure led to many differentially expressed genes in males (but not females), and fewer differentially expressed genes were observed after LL exposure. Using the WGCNA analysis, we found several significant gene modules positively associated with poly IC (in comparison to saline exposure) and LL (in comparison to LD exposure) in males, and less so in females. Interestingly, many of the identified hub bottleneck genes were homologous to human genes associated with both sleep/circadian rhythms and neurodevelopmental disorders as identified by GWA studies.

We investigated whether body weight, measured by body mass index (BMI), has a causal effect on depression symptoms in Finland. Using data drawn from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (N = 1,523, mean age 41.9, SD 5), we used linear regression to establish the relationship between BMI and depression symptoms measured by 21-item Beck’s Depression Inventory. To identify causal relationships, we used the Mendelian randomization (MR) method with weighted sums of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) as instruments for BMI. We employ instruments (polygenic risk scores, PGSs) with varying number of SNPs that ar associated with BMI to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to instrument strength. Based on linear regressions, higher BMI was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms among females (b = 0.238, p = 0.000) and males (b = 0.117, p = 0.019). However, the MR results imply that the positive link applies only to females (b = 0.302, p = 0.007 but not to males (b = -0.070, p = 0.520). Poor instrument strength may explain why many previous studies that have utilized genetic instruments have been unable to identify a statis tically significant link between BMI and depression-related traits.

Liver Biopsy Handling of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD): the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario grossing protocol,"Sergi, C.M.","Metabolic-(non-alcoholic) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD/NAFLD) has increasingly become a worldwide epidemic. It has been suggested that renaming NAFLD to MAFLD is critical in identifying patients with advanced fibrosis and poor cardiovascular outcomes. There are concerns that the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may become a constant drive in the future healthcare of children and adolescents. There is a necessity to tackle the emerging risk factors for NASH-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this narrative review, we present the current protocol of liver biopsy separated between pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical handling. Genetic association investigations have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in the progression of MAFLD-HCC, many of which seem to belong to the lipid metabolism pathways.

Epistasis in neurotransmitter receptors linked to posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder comorbidity in traumatized Chinese,"Xu, L.; Zhang, J.; Yang, H.; Cao, C.; Fang, R.; Liu, P.; Luo, S.; Wang, B.; Zhang, K.; Wang, L.","Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbidity occurs through exposure to trauma with genetic susceptibility. Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and dopamine are neurotransmitters associated with anxiety and stress-related psychiatry through receptors. We attempted to explore the genetic association between two neurotransmitter receptor systems and the PTSD–MDD comorbidity. Methods: Four groups were identified using latent profile analysis (LPA) to examine the patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity among survivors exposed to earthquake-related trauma: low symptoms, predominantly depression, predominantly PTSD, and PTSD–MDD comorbidity. NPY2R (rs4425326), NPY5R (rs11724320), DRD2 (rs1079597), and DRD3 (rs6280) were genotyped from 1,140 Chinese participants exposed to earthquake-related trauma. Main, gene–environment interaction (G × E), and gene–gene interaction (G × G) effects for low symptoms, predominantly depression, and predominantly PTSD were tested using a multinomial logistic model with PTSD–MDD comorbidity as a reference. Results: The results demonstrated that compared to PTSD–MDD comorbidity, epistasis (G × G) NPY2R-DRD2 (rs4425326 × rs1079597) affects low symptoms (β = −0.66, OR = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.32–0.84], p = 0.008, pperm = 0.008) and predominantly PTSD (β = −0.56, OR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.34–0.97], p = 0.037, pperm = 0.039), while NPY2R-DRD3 (rs4425326 × rs6280) impacts low symptoms (β = 0.82, OR = 2.27 [95% CI: 1.26–4.10], p = 0.006, pperm = 0.005) and predominantly depression (β = 1.08, R = 2.95 [95% CI: 1.55–5.62], p = 0.001, pperm = 0.001).

Prediction of antipsychotics efficacy based on a polygenic risk score: a real-world cohort study,"De Pieri, M.; Ferrari, M.; Pistis, G.; Gamma, F.; Marino, F.; Von Gunten, A.; Conus, P.; Cosentino, M.; Eap, C.-B.","Background: Response to antipsychotics is subject to a wide interindividual variability, due to genetic and non-genetic factors. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with response to antipsychotics in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are a powerful tool to aggregate into a single measure the small effects of multiple risk alleles. Materials and methods: We studied the association between a PRS composed of SNPs associated with response to antipsychotics in GWAS studies (PRSresponse) in a real-world sample of patients (N = 460) with different diagnoses (schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, depressive, neurocognitive, substance use disorders and miscellaneous). Two other PRSs composed of SNPs previously associated with risk of schizophrenia (PRSschizophrenia1 and PRSschizophrenia2) were also tested for their association with response to treatment. Results: PRSresponse was significantly associated with response to antipsychotics considering the whole cohort (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.03–1.26, p = 0.010), the subgroup of patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder (OR = 1.18, CI = 1.02–1.37, p = 0.022, N = 235), with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (OR = 1.24, CI = 1.04–1.47, p = 0.01, N = 176) and with schizophrenia (OR = 1.27, CI = 1.04–1.55, p = 0.01, N = 149). Sensitivity and specificity were sub-optimal (schizophrenia 62%, 61%; schizophrenia spectrum 56%, 55%; schizophrenia spectrum plus bipolar disorder 60%, 56%; all patients 63%, 58%, respectively).

Correlation analysis between HLA-DQA1*0102/DQB1*0602 genotypes and narcolepsy patients in China,"Zhao, W.; Zhang, B.; Yan, Z.; Zhao, M.; Zhang, X.; Liu, X.; Tang, J.","Background and objective: At present, the etiology of narcolepsy is not fully understood, and it is generally believed to be an autoimmune reaction caused by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes are strongly associated with this gene, especially HLA-DQB1*0602/DQA1*0102. In this study, we mainly analyzed the correlation between different genotypes of HLA-DQB1*0602/DQA1*0102 and clinical manifestations in Chinese patients with narcolepsy. Experimental method: Narcolepsy patients who were treated at the Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University from January 2021 to September 2023 were selected. General information, sleep monitoring data, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels, and human leukocyte antigen gene typing data were collected. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0, and the graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism 9.5. Main results: A total of 78 patients were included in this study. The DQA1 and DQB1 gene loci were detected in 54 patients, and only the DQB1 gene locus was detected in 24 narcoleptic patients. The most common allele at the HLA-DQB1 locus was *0602 (89.7%), and the most common genotype at this locus was *0602*0301 (19.2%), followed by *0602*0602 (17.9%). The most common phenotype of the HLA-DQA1 locus is *0102 (92.6%), and the most common genotype of this locus is *0102*0102 (27.8%), followed by *0102*0505 (14.8%). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between HLA-DQB1*0602-positive and HLA-DQB1*0602-negative patients in terms of orexin-A levels, presence or absence of cataplexy, UNS, PSG sleep latency, REM sleep latency, N1 sleep percentage, oxygen depletion index, and average REM latency on the MSLT. The HLA-DQA1*0102-positive and HLA-DQA1*0102-negative patients showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in disease course, presence or absence of sudden onset, PSG REM sleep latency, N1 sleep percentage, and average REM latency on the MSLT. There were significant differences in the average REM latency of the MSLT between HLA-DQB1*0602/DQA1*0102 homozygous and heterozygous patients p < 0.05, and no differences were found in the baseline data, orexin-A levels, scale scores, or other sleep parameters. Conclusion: Different genotypes of HLA-DQA1*0102/DQB1*0602 are associated with symptoms of cataplexy in Chinese narcoleptic patients.

Transiently elevated expression of different forms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the neonatal medial prefrontal cortex affected anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in adolescence,"Lanshakov, D.; Shaburova, E.; Sukhareva, E.; Bulygina, V.; Drozd, U.; Larionova, I.; Gerashchenko, T.; Shnaider, T.; Denisov, E.V.; Kalinina, T.","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a secreted molecule that plays an important role in the survival and growth of nerve cells. BDNF undergoes complex post-translational processing with cellular proteases. Pro- and mature BDNF forms bind to different receptor types in the brain. BDNF is prominent in the neonatal cerebral cortex. The neonatal period is critical for the proper development of the brain and nervous system. Disruptions in these critical periods can have long-lasting effects on behavior and mental health. Individuals who experience adverse effects in the neonatal period have demonstrated a predisposition to depression and other neurobehavioral disorders. In this work we studied the influence of transient expression (P3–P8) elevation of pro-, mature and mutant forms of BDNF that could not be processed with cellular convertases in the neonatal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adolescents. Elevated expression of mature BDNF (LV-BDNF) increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior at P30. Only immobility in the tail suspension test was increased after expression of mutant BDNF (LV-pBDNF mut). Using our RNA-seq data and available online sn-RNAseq results, we investigated transcriptomic changes in the neonatal mPFC at P8 that underlie subsequent behavioral changes. Mature BDNF expression caused an increased transcriptional response in perivascular stromal cells (PSC) with such genes: Ptgds, Slc6a13, Slc22a6, Bnc2, Slc13a4, Aldh1a2. Based on GWAS data, Ptgds is a candidate gene associated with ADHD and bipolar disorder Pujol-Gualdo et al. (2021); Marín-Méndez et al. (2012); Munkholm et al. (2015). LV-pBDNF mut caused a complete opposite set of transcriptional changes in the PSC compared to LV-BDNF. The observed similar behavioral phenotype after expression of mature and mutant forms of BDNF together with the detected genes related to bipolar disorder underpinned that Bdnf could play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of this neurobehavioral disorder.",2024,,PeerJ,12,11,,,10.7717/peerj.18465,,#1785,Lanshakov 2024,"",""
The association of genetic variation in CACNA1C with resting-state functional connectivity in youth bipolar disorder,"Jiang, X.; Sultan, A.A.; Dimick, M.K.; Zai, C.C.; Kennedy, J.L.; MacIntosh, B.J.; Goldstein, B.I.","Background: CACNA1C rs1006737 A allele, identified as a genetic risk variant for bipolar disorder (BD), is associated with anomalous functional connectivity in adults with and without BD. Studies have yet to investigate the association of CACNA1C rs1006737 with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in youth BD. Methods: Participants included 139 youth with BD-I, -II, or -not otherwise specified, ages 13–20 years, including 27 BD A-carriers, 41 BD non-carriers, 32 healthy controls (HC) A-carriers, and 39 HC non-carriers. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were examined as regions-of-interest in seed-to-voxel analyses. General linear models included main effects of diagnosis and rs1006737, and an interaction term, controlling for age, sex, and race. Results: We observed a main effect of BD diagnosis on rsFC between the right amygdala and the right occipital pole (p = 0.02), and a main effect of rs1006737 genotypes on rsFC between the right OFC and bilateral occipital cortex (p < 0.001). Two significant BD diagnosis-by-CACNA1C rs1006737 interactions were also identified. The A allele was associated with positive rsFC between the right ACC and right amygdala in BD but negative rsFC in HC (p = 0.01), and negative rsFC between the left OFC and left putamen in BD but positive rsFC in HC (p = 0.01). Conclusion: This study found that the rs1006737 A allele, identified as a genetic risk variant for BD in adults, was differentially associated with rsFC in youth with BD in regions relevant to emotion, executive function, and reward.

Genotype-by-diagnosis interaction influences self-control in human cocaine addiction,"Graczyk, M.M.; Sahakian, B.J.; Robbins, T.W.; Ersche, K.D.","Not everyone who uses drugs loses control over their intake, which is a hallmark of addiction. Although familial risk studies suggest significant addiction heritability, the genetic basis of vulnerability to drug addiction remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between self-control, cocaine use, and the rs36024 single nucleotide polymorphism of the noradrenaline transporter gene (SLC6A2). We hypothesize that C-allele-carrying adults show impaired self-control, as measured by the stop-signal task and demonstrated previously in adolescents, and further exacerbated by chronic cocaine use. Patients with cocaine use disorder (CUD, n = 79) and healthy unrelated participants with no history of drug abuse (n = 54) completed the stop-signal task. All participants were genotyped for rs36024 allelic variants (CC/TT homozygotes, CT heterozygotes). We measured mean stop-signal reaction time, reflecting the ability to inhibit ongoing motor responses, reaction times to go stimuli, and the proportion of successful stops. CUD patients showed prolonged stop-signal reaction time, however, there was no main effect of rs36024 genotype. Importantly, there was a significant genotype-by-diagnosis interaction such that CUD patients with CC genotype had longer stop-signal reaction time and fewer successful stops compared with CC healthy controls and TT CUD patients. CT CUD patients showed an intermediate performance. Self-control deficits were associated with cocaine use disorder diagnosis, which interacts with the noradrenaline transporter rs36024 polymorphism. Our findings suggest that rs36024 may represent a potential genetic vulnerability marker, which facilitates the transition from first cocaine use to addiction by weakening the inhibitory control over behavior.",2023,,Translational Psychiatry,13,1,,,10.1038/s41398-023-02347-z,,#1792,Graczyk 2023,"",""
"Genetic propensity, socioeconomic status, and trajectories of depression over a course of 14 years in older adults","Kosciuszko, M.; Steptoe, A.; Ajnakina, O.","Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease among older adults. The study aimed to investigate the interplay between socio-economic markers (education and financial resources) and polygenic predisposition influencing individual differences in depressive symptoms and their change over time in older adults, which is of central relevance for preventative strategies. The sample encompassing n = 6202 adults aged ≥50 years old with a follow-up period of 14 years was utilised from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Polygenic scores for depressive symptoms were calculated using summary statistics for (1) single-trait depressive symptoms (PGS-DSsingle), and (2) multi-trait including depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, neuroticism, loneliness, and self-rated health (PGS-DSmulti-trait). The depressive symptoms over the past week were measured using the eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. One standard deviation increase in each PGS was associated with a higher baseline score in depressive symptoms. Each additional year of completed schooling was associated with lower baseline depression symptoms (β = −0.06, 95%CI = −0.07 to −0.05, p < 0.001); intermediate and lower wealth were associated with a higher baseline score in depressive symptoms. Although there was a weak interaction effect between PGS-DSs and socio-economic status in association with the baseline depressive symptoms, there were no significant relationships of PGS-DSs, socio-economic factors, and rate of change in the depressive symptoms during the 14-year follow-up period. Common genetic variants for depressive symptoms are associated with a greater number of depressive symptoms onset but not with their rate of change in the following 14 years. Lower socio-economic status is an important factor influencing individual levels of depressive symptoms, independently from polygenic predisposition to depressive symptoms.",2023,,Translational Psychiatry,13,1,,,10.1038/s41398-023-02367-9,,#1793,Kosciuszko 2023,"",""
No difference in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volumes across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions in later childhood and adolescence,"Peterson, M.; Whetten, C.; Clark, A.M.; Nielsen, J.A.","Background: While autism spectrum disorder has been associated with various organizational and developmental aberrations in the brain, an increase in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume has recently garnered attention. A series of studies indicate that an increased volume between the ages of 6 months and 4 years was both predictive of the autism diagnosis and symptom severity regardless of genetic risk for the condition. However, there remains a minimal understanding regarding the specificity of an increased volume of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid to autism. Methods: In the present study, we explored extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volumes in children and adolescents ages 5–21 years with various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. We hypothesized that an elevated extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume would be found in autism compared with typical development and the other diagnostic group. We tested this hypothesis by employing a cross-sectional dataset of 446 individuals (85 autistic, 60 typically developing, and 301 other diagnosis). An analysis of covariance was used to examine differences in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volumes between these groups as well as a group by age interaction in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Results: Inconsistent with our hypothesis, we found no group differences in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume in this cohort. However, in replication of previous work, a doubling of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume across adolescence was found. Further investigation into the relationship between extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume and cortical thickness suggested that this increase in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume may be driven by a decrease in cortical thickness. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis found no relationship between extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume and sleep disturbances. Conclusions: These results indicate that an increased volume of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid may be limited to autistic individuals younger than 5 years. Additionally, extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume does not differ between autistic, neurotypical, and other psychiatric conditions after age 4.",2023,,Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders,15,1,,,10.1186/s11689-023-09477-x,,#1795,Peterson 2023,"",""

Although no genome-wide significant locus was identified, SNP-based heritability of AAO was estimated to be between 17 and 21%, indicating a moderate contribution of common variants. We also performed cross-trait PRS analyses with a set of mental disorders and identified a negative association between AAO and common variants for SCZ, childhood maltreatment and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We also investigated the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in AAO and found an association with the length and number of deletions (P-value = 0.03), whereas the presence of CNVs previously reported in SCZ was not associated with earlier onset. To our knowledge, this is the largest GWAS of AAO of SCZ to date in individuals from European ancestry, and the first study to determine the involvement of common variants in the heritability of AAO.

"The physical and psychiatric health conditions related to autism genetic scores, across genetic ancestries, sexes and age-groups in electronic health records","Niarchou, M.; Miller-Fleming, T.; Malow, B.A.; Davis, L.K.","Background: Although polygenic scores (PGS) for autism have been related to various psychiatric and medical conditions, most studies to date have been conducted in research ascertained populations. We aimed to identify the psychiatric and physical conditions associated with autism PGS in a health care setting. Methods: We computed PGS for 12,383 unrelated participants of African genetic ancestry (AF) and 65,363 unrelated participants of European genetic ancestry (EU) from Vanderbilt’s de-identified biobank. Next, we performed phenome wide association studies of the autism PGS within these two genetic ancestries. Results: Seven associations surpassed the Bonferroni adjusted threshold for statistical significance (p = 0.05/1374 = 3.6 × 10−5) in the EU participants, including mood disorders (OR (95%CI) = 1.08(1.05 to 1.10), p = 1.0 × 10−10), autism (OR (95%CI) = 1.34(1.24 to 1.43), p = 1.2 × 10–9), and breast cancer (OR (95%CI) = 1.09(1.05 to 1.14), 2.6 × 10−5). There was no statistical evidence for PGS-phenotype associations in the AF participants. Conditioning on the diagnosis of autism or on median body mass index (BMI) did not impact the strength of the reported associations. Although we observed some sex differences in the pattern of associations, there was no significant interaction between sex and autism PGS. Finally, the associations between autism PGS and autism diagnosis were stronger in childhood and adolescence, while the associations with mood disorders and breast cancer were stronger in adulthood. Discussion: Our findings indicate that autism PGS is not only related to autism diagnosis but may also be related to adult-onset conditions, including mood disorders and some cancers. Conclusions: Our study raises the hypothesis that genes associated with autism may also increase the risk for cancers later in life.

CARE as a wearable derived feature linking circadian amplitude to human cognitive functions,"Cui, S.; Lin, Q.; Gui, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Lu, H.; Zhao, H.; Wang, X.; Li, X.; Jiang, F.","Circadian rhythms are crucial for regulating physiological and behavioral processes. Pineal hormone melatonin is often used to measure circadian amplitude but its collection is costly and time-consuming. Wearable activity data are promising alternative, but the most commonly used measure, relative amplitude, is subject to behavioral masking. In this study, we firstly derive a feature named circadian activity rhythm energy (CARE) to better characterize circadian amplitude and validate CARE by correlating it with melatonin amplitude (Pearson’s r = 0.46, P = 0.007) among 33 healthy participants. Then we investigate its association with cognitive functions in an adolescent dataset (Chinese SCHEDULE-A, n = 1703) and an adult dataset (UK Biobank, n = 92,202), and find that CARE is significantly associated with Global Executive Composite (β = 30.86, P = 0.016) in adolescents, and reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (OR = 0.01, 3.42, and 11.47 respectively, all P < 0.001) in adults. Finally, we identify one genetic locus with 126 CARE-associated SNPs using the genome-wide association study, of which 109 variants are used as instrumental variables in the Mendelian Randomization analysis, and the results show a significant causal effect of CARE on reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (β = -59.91, 7.94, and 16.85 respectively, all P < 0.0001).

Neural representations of anxiety in adolescents with anorexia nervosa: a multivariate approach,"Seiger, R.; Reggente, N.; Majid, D.S.-A.; Ly, R.; Tadayonnejad, R.; Strober, M.; Feusner, J.D.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by low body weight, fear of gaining weight, and distorted body image. Anxiety may play a role in the formation and course of the illness, especially related to situations involving food, eating, weight, and body image. To understand distributed patterns and consistency of neural responses related to anxiety, we enrolled 25 female adolescents with AN and 22 non-clinical female adolescents with mild anxiety who underwent two fMRI sessions in which they saw personalized anxiety-provoking word stimuli and neutral words. Consistency in brain response patterns across trials was determined using a multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) approach within anxiety circuits and in a whole-brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis. In the AN group there was higher representational similarity for anxiety-provoking compared with neutral stimuli predominantly in prefrontal regions including the frontal pole, medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, although no significant group differences. Severity of anxiety correlated with consistency of brain responses within anxiety circuits and in cortical and subcortical regions including the frontal pole, middle frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, lateral occipital cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Higher consistency of activation in those with more severe anxiety symptoms suggests the possibility of a greater degree of conditioned brain responses evoked by personally-relevant emotional stimuli. Anxiety elicited by disorder-related stimuli may activate stereotyped, previously-learned neural responses within- and outside of classical anxiety circuits. Results have implications for understanding consistent and automatic responding to environmental stimuli that may play a role in maintenance of AN.",2023,,Translational Psychiatry,13,1,,,10.1038/s41398-023-02581-5,,#1802,Seiger 2023,"",""

Despite previous studies suggested its high heritability, its genetic basis, especially in ADHD, remains unclear. The current study aimed to comprehensively explore the genetic basis of visual-spatial working memory (VSWM) in ADHD using wide-ranging genetic analyses. Methods: The current study recruited a cohort consisted of 802 ADHD individuals, all met DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria. VSWM was assessed by Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT), which is a widely used psychological test include four memory indexes: detail delayed (DD), structure delayed (SD), structure immediate (SI), detail immediate (DI). Genetic analyses were conducted at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene, pathway, polygenic and protein network levels. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) were based on summary statistics of various psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD), and substance use disorder (SUD). Results: Analyses at the single-marker level did not yield significant results (5E−08). However, the potential signals with P values less than E−05 and their mapped genes suggested the regulation of VSWM involved both ocular and neural system related genes, moreover, ADHD-related genes were also involved.

Candidate pathway enrichment analyses (N = 53) found that forebrain neuron fate commitment significantly enriched in DD (P = 4.78E−04, Padj = 0.025), and dopamine transport enriched in SD (P = 5.90E-04, Padj = 0.031). We also observed a significant negative relationship between DD scores and ADHD PRS scores (P = 0.0025, Empirical P = 0.048). Conclusions: Our results emphasized the joint contribution of ocular and neural genes in regulating VSWM. The study reveals a shared genetic basis between ADHD and VSWM, with GWAS indicating the involvement of ADHD-related genes in VSWM. Additionally, the PRS analysis identifies a significant relationship between ADHD-PRS and DD scores. Overall, our findings shed light on the genetic basis of VSWM deficits in ADHD, and may have important implications for future research and clinical practice.",2023,,Behavioral and Brain Functions,19,1,,,10.1186/s12993-023-00216-9,,#1804,Zhao 2023,"",""
Impact of obesity on female puberty and pubertal disorders,"Bauman, D.","The worldwide epidemic of obesity appears to be one of the crucial health problems. One-third of children and adolescents in the United States are classified as either overweight or obese and 6% of adolescents are severely obese. With the development of high technology, children, and adolescents, spend more time in sedentary life. Together with the availability of consuming fast caloric food, it is almost unavoidable to get an imbalance between caloric intake and caloric expenditure of energy, resulting in the accumulation of fat-energy stores. Obesity has an enormous impact on physical and psychological health and is associated with more than 29 adverse health consequences previously identified in the adult population only, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, postmenopausal breast cancer, and others. In addition, excess adiposity may exert a harmful effect on the reproductive system, resulting in precocious puberty, irregular menstrual cycle, polycystic ovary syndrome, and high-risk sexual behavior. Intervention programs for healthy lifestyle modification, consisting of caloric restriction together with physical activity did not gain the expected efficacy. Other approaches as medical and surgical therapies are currently not evidence-based for the young population. The obesity crisis in children and adolescents requires a better understanding of etiology, pathophysiology, and management of obesity in this unique population.

We applied machine learning to identify clinical, sociodemographic, familial, and environmental variables that are associated with TRS and could potentially predict TRS in the future. Study design: Baseline and follow-up data on trait(-like) variables from the Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP) study were used. For the main analysis, we selected patients with non-affective psychotic disorders who met TRS (n = 200) or antipsychotic-responsive criteria (n = 423) throughout the study. For a sensitivity analysis, we only selected patients who met TRS (n = 76) or antipsychotic-responsive criteria (n = 123) at follow-up but not at baseline. Random forest models were trained to predict TRS in both datasets. SHapley Additive exPlanation values were used to examine the variables' contributions to the prediction. Study results: Premorbid functioning, age at onset, and educational degree were most consistently associated with TRS across both analyses. Marital status, current household, intelligence quotient, number of moves, and family loading score for substance abuse also consistently contributed to the prediction of TRS in the main or sensitivity analysis. The diagnostic performance of our models was modest (area under the curve: 0.66–0.69).

The dataset offers a valuable life course panorama, encompassing living conditions, socioeconomic status, familial connections, personality traits, values, preferences, health, and well-being. To amplify research opportunities further, we have extended the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) by collecting genetic data from 2,598 participants, yielding the first genotyped dataset for Germany based on a representative population sample (SOEP-G). The sample includes 107 full-sibling pairs, 501 parent-offspring pairs, and 152 triads, which overlap with the parent-offspring pairs. Leveraging the results from wellpowered genome-wide association studies, we created a repository comprising 66 polygenic indices (PGIs) in the SOEP-G sample. We show that the PGIs for height, BMI, and educational attainment capture 22∼24%, 12∼13%, and 9% of the variance in the respective phenotypes. Using the PGIs for height and BMI, we demonstrate that the considerable increase in average height and the decrease in average BMI in more recent birth cohorts cannot be attributed to genetic shifts within the German population or to age effects alone. These findings suggest an important role of improved environmental conditions in driving these changes. Furthermore, we show that higher values in the PGIs for educational attainment and the highest math class are associated with better self-rated health, illustrating complex relationships between genetics, cognition, behavior, socio-economic status, and health. In summary, the SOEP-G data and the PGI repository we created provide a valuableresource for studying individual differences, inequalities, life-course development, health, and interactions between genetic predispositions and the environment.

Assessment of Fatigue in Psoriatic Arthritis and Cutaneous Psoriasis Patients,"","Brief SummaryPsoriatic arthritis is characterized with pain, swelling and joint stiffness. These are inflammatory reactions against tendons, ligaments and joints associated with fatigue. In France, almost 93.000 people are affected by psoriatic arthritis and the main symptoms appear between 30 and 50 years old. Psoriatic arthritis may be due to a genetic predisposition involving the HLA B27 gene, or to environmental factors such as stress, physical or psychological trauma, or infection. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension can also be factors associated with the onset of psoriatic arthritis. Cutaneous psoriasis is a non-contagious chronic inflammatory skin disease, where the skin renews itself at an abnormally rapid rate. In France, between 2 and 3 million people are affected by cutaneous psoriasis, approximately 60.000 new cases every year. The disease begin in adolescence or young adulthood. There are multiples forms of cutaneous psoriasis (plaque, guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, inverse, facial, scalp, nail and mucous membranes). The main symptom is the appearance of thick red patches of varying size, covered with white dead skin. These lesions are most often found on the hands, elbows, knees, lower back, face or scalp. There is little to no itching. During periods of remission, lesions can disappear completely or partially, then reappear during a new attack, called a ""flare-up"". A familial genetic predisposition is present in 1/3 of psoriasis patients. Other immune and environmental factors, such as medication, irritations, sun exposure or psychological state, can influence psoriasis flare-ups. Psoriasis has no serious health consequences, but it can be aesthetically unpleasant, affect relationships and psychological well-being. Fatigue is a common symptom in psoriatic arthritis patients, and can significantly affect quality of life and work capacity. Fatigue, which affects over 50% of psoriatic arthritis patients, is a major component of the disease's impact. Fatigue in psoriatic arthritis is a much-discussed topic in the current scientific literature. Although less well documented, patients with cutaneous psoriasis also experience fatigue. Several clinical trials show that, once the disease has been treated, fatigue tends to diminish, but in some cases, the treatment itself may play a role in the vicious fatigue circle. The risk of suffering other skin manifestations despite being under treatment can often be misunderstood by the patient, leading to increased depression and fatigue. Overall, treatments are more likely to play an important role in the variability of fatigue. Ultimately, fatigue is a multifactorial symptom that can be linked either to the disease itself, or to the therapies used. It therefore appears to be the most difficult symptom to treat with commercially available therapies. As fatigue is a major symptom of psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous psoriasis, it is essential to know how the therapies offered influence this symptom, and to study whether certain therapies are more likely to increase it, despite their efficacy on joint and skin symptoms. It is also relevant to determine whether fatigue is correlated with disease severity, duration and even more so with the therapy used, to better understand the psychological impact of patients with psoriatic arthritis or cutaneous psoriasis.",2023,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#1821,,"",""
An Ounce of Prevention is the Only Cure: Nationwide Clinical and Financial Outcomes of Self-Inflicted Firearm Injuries,"Tran, Z.; Bonnick, K.; Byun, J.; Cho, N.Y.; Benharash, P.; Mukherjee, K.","Background: Self-inflicted gunshot wounds (SIGSWs) remain a leading, preventable cause of death in the United States. The present study evaluated patient demographics, operative characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and resource utilization between patients with SIGSW and other GSW. Methods: The 2016-2020 National Inpatient Sample was queried for patients ≥16 years old admitted following gunshot wounds. Patients were categorized as SIGSW if they were injured through self-harm. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of SIGSW on outcomes. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality with complications, costs, and length of stay secondarily considered. Results: Of an estimated 157,795 surviving to hospital admission, 14,670 (9.30%) were SIGSW. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds were more commonly female (18.1 vs 11.3%), insured by Medicare (21.1 vs 5.0%), and white (70.8 vs 22.3%) (all P <.001) compared to non-SIGSW. Psychiatric illness was more prevalent in SIGSW (46.0 vs 6.6%, P <.001). Additionally, SIGSW more frequently underwent neurologic (10.7 vs 2.9%) and facial operations (12.5 vs 3.2%) (both P <.001). After adjustment, SIGSW was associated with greater odds of mortality (AOR: 12.4, 95% CI: 10.4-14.7). Length of stay (β: +1.5 days, 95% CI:.8-2.1) and costs (β: +$3.6 K, 95% CI: 1.4-5.7) were significantly greater in SIGSW. Conclusions: Self-inflicted gunshot wounds are associated with increased mortality compared to other GSW, likely due to the increased proportion of injuries in the head and neck region. This lethality, coupled with the high prevalence of psychiatric illness in this population, indicates that efforts must be made to intervene through primary prevention, including enhanced screening and weapon safety considerations for those at risk.",2023,,American Surgeon,89,10,4084-4088,,10.1177/00031348231177927,,#1822,Tran 2023,"",""

Here, we used causal inference and triangulation with 2 levels of biology to substantiate relationships between sports participation and dimensional psychopathology in youths. Methods: Baseline data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which recruited children from 9 to 10 years of age across the United States, were included in multilevel regression models to assess relationships between lifetime participation in team sports (TS), individual sports, and nonsports activities and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores. We calculated polygenic risk scores for 8 psychiatric disorders to assess interactions with sports exposure on CBCL scores among European descendants. Following rigorous quality control, FreeSurfer-extracted brain magnetic resonance imaging structural data were examined for mediation of CBCL–activities relationships. Results: Among those with complete data (N = 10,411), causal estimates using inverse probability weighting associated lifetime TS exposure with a 1.05-point reduction in CBCL total (95% CI, −1.54 to −0.56, p < .0001) a relationship that was specific to TS and strengthened with more years of exposure. Associations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder polygenic loading with CBCL total weakened in European children with TS exposure (n = 4041; beta = −0.93, SE = 0.38, p = .013).

However, it is unclear whether these alterations predate the onset of clinically relevant symptoms. Our aim was to explore in vivo measures of excitatory/inhibitory balance in 22q11.2 deletion carriers, a population at genetic risk for psychosis. Methods: Glx (glutamate+glutamine) and GABA+ (gamma-aminobutyric acid with macromolecules and homocarnosine) concentrations were estimated in the anterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal cortex, and hippocampus using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) sequence and the Gannet toolbox in 52 deletion carriers and 42 control participants. T1-weighted images were acquired longitudinally and processed with FreeSurfer version 6 to extract hippocampal volume. Subgroup analyses were conducted in deletion carriers with psychotic symptoms. Results: While no differences were found in the anterior cingulate cortex, deletion carriers had higher levels of Glx in the hippocampus and superior temporal cortex and lower levels of GABA+ in the hippocampus than control participants. We additionally found a higher Glx concentration in the hippocampus of deletion carriers with psychotic symptoms. Finally, more pronounced hippocampal atrophy was significantly associated with increased Glx levels in deletion carriers. Conclusions: We provide evidence for an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in temporal brain structures of deletion carriers, with a further hippocampal Glx increase in individuals with psychotic symptoms that was associated with hippocampal atrophy. These results are in line with theories proposing abnormally enhanced glutamate levels as a mechanistic explanation for hippocampal atrophy via excitotoxicity.

"Explainable machine-learning algorithms to differentiate bipolar disorder from major depressive disorder using self-reported symptoms, vital signs, and blood-based markers","Zhu, T.; Liu, X.; Wang, J.; Kou, R.; Hu, Y.; Yuan, M.; Yuan, C.; Luo, L.; Zhang, W.","Background and objective: Caused by shared genetic risk factors and similar neuropsychological symptoms, bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are at high risk of misdiagnosis, which is associated with ineffective treatment and worsening of outcomes. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic system, based on electronic medical records (EMR) data, to mimic the clinical reasoning of human physicians to differentiate MDD and BD (especially BD depressive episodes) patients about to be admitted to a hospital and, hence, reduce the misdiagnosis of BD as MDD on admission. In addition, we examined to what extent our ML model could be made interpretable by quantifying and visualizing the features that drive the predictions. Methods: By identifying 16,311 patients admitted to a hospital located in western China between 2009 and 2018 with a recorded main diagnosis of MDD or BD, we established three sub-cohorts with different combinations of features for both the MDD-BD cohort and the MDD-BD depressive episodes cohort, respectively. Four different ML algorithms (logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and support vector machine) and four train-test splits were used to train and validate diagnostic models, and explainable methods (SHAP and Break Down) were utilized to analyze the contribution of each of the features at both population-level and individual-level, including feature importance, feature interaction, and feature effect on prediction decision for a specific subject. Results: The XGBoost algorithm provided the best test performance (AUC: 0.838 (0.810–0.867), PPV: 0.810 and NPV: 0.834) for separating patients with BD from those with MDD. Core predictors included symptoms (mood-up, exciting, bad sleep, loss of interest, talking, mood-down, provoke), along with age, job, myocardial enzyme markers (creatine kinase, hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), diabetes-associated marker (glucose), bone function marker (alkaline phosphatase), non-enzymatic antioxidant (uric acid), markers of immune/inflammation (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, basophil percentage, monocyte count), cardiovascular function marker (low density lipoprotein), renal marker (total protein), liver biochemistry marker (indirect bilirubin), and vital signs like pulse. For separating patients with BD depressive episodes from those with MDD, the test AUC was 0.777 (0.732–0.822), with PPV 0.576 and NPV 0.899. Additional validation in models built with self-reported symptoms removed from the feature set, showed test AUC of 0.701 (0.666–0.736) for differentiating BD and MDD, and AUC of 0.564 (0.515–0.614) for detecting patients in BD depressive episodes from MDD patients. Validation in the datasets without removing the patients with comorbidity showed an AUC of 0.826 (0.806–0.846).

However, it is unclear whether the distinct disorder-specific mechanisms operate during adolescence despite the overlap among disorders. Methods: We studied a large cohort of more than 11 000 preadolescent (age 9–10 yr) children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development cohort. We adopted a regrouping approach to compare cortical thickness (CT) alterations and longitudinal changes between healthy controls (n = 4041) and externalizing (n = 1182), internalizing (n = 1959) and thought disorder (n = 347) groups. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on regional CT across 4468 unrelated European youth. Results: Youth with externalizing or internalizing disorders exhibited increased regional CT compared with controls. Externalizing (p = 8 × 10−4, Cohen d = 0.10) and internalizing disorders (p = 2 × 10−3, Cohen d = 0.08) shared thicker CT in the left pars opercularis. The somatosensory and the primary auditory cortex were uniquely affected in externalizing disorders, whereas the primary motor cortex and higher-order visual association areas were uniquely affected in internalizing disorders. Only youth with externalizing disorders showed decelerated cortical thinning from age 10–12 years. The GWAS found 59 genome-wide significant associated genetic variants across these regions. Cortical thickness in common regions was associated with glutamatergic neurons, while internalizing-specific regional CT was associated with astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and GABAergic neurons. Limitations: The sample size of the GWAS was relatively small. Conclusion: Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of specificity in CT, developmental trajectories and underlying genetic underpinnings among externalizing and internalizing disorders during early adolescence.

Association between Neuroligin-1 polymorphism and plasma glutamine levels in individuals with autism spectrum disorder,"Lee, I.-H.; Walker, D.I.; Lin, Y.; Smith, M.R.; Mandl, K.D.; Jones, D.P.; Kong, S.W.","Background: Unravelling the relationships between candidate genes and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotypes remains an outstanding challenge. Endophenotypes, defined as inheritable, measurable quantitative traits, might provide intermediary links between genetic risk factors and multifaceted ASD phenotypes. In this study, we sought to determine whether plasma metabolite levels could serve as endophenotypes in individuals with ASD and their family members. Methods: We employed an untargeted, high-resolution metabolomics platform to analyse 14,342 features across 1099 plasma samples. These samples were collected from probands and their family members participating in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) (N = 658), compared with neurotypical individuals enrolled in the PrecisionLink Health Discovery (PLHD) program at Boston Children's Hospital (N = 441). We conducted a metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) analysis using whole-genome genotyping data from each cohort in AGRE and PLHD, aiming to prioritize significant mQTL and metabolite pairs that were exclusively observed in AGRE. Findings: Within the AGRE group, we identified 54 significant associations between genotypes and metabolite levels (P < 5.27 × 10−11), 44 of which were not observed in the PLHD group. Plasma glutamine levels were found to be associated with variants in the NLGN1 gene, a gene that encodes post-synaptic cell-adhesion molecules in excitatory neurons. This association was not detected in the PLHD group. Notably, a significant negative correlation between plasma glutamine and glutamate levels was observed in the AGRE group, but not in the PLHD group. Furthermore, plasma glutamine levels showed a negative correlation with the severity of restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRB) in ASD, although no direct association was observed between RRB severity and the NLGN1 genotype. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that plasma glutamine levels could potentially serve as an endophenotype, thus establishing a link between the genetic risk associated with NLGN1 and the severity of RRB in ASD. This identified association could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets, assist in selecting specific cohorts for clinical trials, and provide insights into target symptoms for future ASD treatment strategies.

Efforts to delineate the contributors to disability in SSDs have highlighted prominent roles for a diverse range of symptoms, physical health conditions, substance use disorders, neurobiological changes, and social factors. These findings have provided valuable advances in knowledge and helped define broad patterns of illness and outcomes across SSDs. Unsurprisingly, there have also been conflicting findings for many of these determinants that reflect the heterogeneous population of individuals with SSDs and the challenges of conceptualizing and treating SSDs as a unitary categorical construct. Presently it is not possible to identify the functional course on an individual level that would enable a personalized approach to treatment to alter the individual’s functional trajectory and mitigate the ensuing disability they would otherwise experience. To address this ongoing challenge, this study aims to conduct a longitudinal multimodal investigation of a large cohort of individuals with SSDs in order to establish discrete trajectories of personal recovery, disability, and community functioning, as well as the antecedents and predictors of these trajectories.

Early life stress impairs brain and mental development during childhood increasing the risk of developing psychiatric disorders,"Nakama, N.; Usui, N.; Doi, M.; Shimada, S.","In recent years, it has become known that stress in childhood, called early life stress (ELS), affects the mental health of children, adolescents, and adults. Child maltreatment (CM) is an inappropriate form of childcare that interferes with children's normal brain and mind development. Previous studies have reported that CM severely affects brain development and function. For example, ELS causes brain vulnerability and increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. In addition, it is known that the different types and timing of abuse have different effects on the brain. Epidemiological and clinical studies are being conducted to understand the mechanism underlying abuse on a child's mental health and appropriate brain development; however, they are not fully understood. Therefore, studies using animal models, as well as humans, have been conducted to better understand the effects of CM. In this review, we discuss the effects of comparing previous findings on different types of CM in human and animal models. However, it should be noted that there are differences between animal models and humans such as genetic polymorphism and susceptibility to stress.

Polymorphism of Estrogen Receptor Genes and Its Interactions With Neurodevelopmental Genes in Attention Deficit HyperactivitDisorder Among Chinese Han Descent,"Lin, Y.; Li, H.; Zhang, J.; Yang, Z.; Zhou, Y.; Liu, L.; Qian, Q.","Objective Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder with significant gender dences. The sexual dimorphism of ADHD may be associated with estrogen acting through estrogen receptors (ESR). This study invgates the impact of ESR gene polymorphism and its interactions with neurodevelopmental genes on ADHD susceptibility. Methods The study compared genotyping data of single nucleotide polymorphisms in ESR1 and ESR2 in 1,035 ADHD cases and 962 controls. The gene-gene interactions between ESR genes and three neurodevelopmental genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa gene [SNAP25], and cadherin-13 [CDH13]) in ADHD were investigated using generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction and verified by logistic regression analysis. Results The G allele of rs960070/ESR2 (empirical p=0.0076) and the A allele of rs8017441/ESR2 (empirical p=0.0426) were found significantly higher in ADHD cases than in the controls but not in male or female subgroups. Though no difference was found in all subjects or females, the A allele of rs9340817/ESR1 (empirical p=0.0344) was found significantly higher in ADHD cases than controls in males. We also found genetic interaction models between ESR2 gene, neurodevelopmental genes and ADHD susceptibility in males (ESR2 rs960070/BDNF rs6265/BDNF rs2049046/SNAP25 rs362987/CDH13 rs6565113) and females (ESR2 rs960070/BDNF rs6265/ BDNF rs2049046) separately, though it was negative in overall subjects.

"An Explorative and Experimental Study to Assess the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Effectiveness of Early Intervention With Light, Lifestyle and ImCT Therapy in Individuals at Risk for Bipolar Disorder","","Brief SummaryIn the current study, the feasibility, acceptability and effectivity of a new add-on early intervention program for individuals at risk for the development of bipolar disorder is evaluated. This intervention program entails psycho-education, light and lifestyle therapy in combination with Imagery focused Cognitive Therapy (ImCT). The program aims to contribute to early intervention by focusing on subclinical mood swings, anxiety symptoms, circadian rhythm and lifestyle factors such as activity level. We hypothesize a relationship between this early intervention and a significant improvement in mood symptoms, anxiety, subjective and objective sleep factors and lifestyle variables. Also, the feasibility, acceptability and associations with clinical improvement of symptoms will be studied. Additionally, in a separate validation study, data will be collected to validate a new instrument for the early detection of those at risk for bipolar disorders. The Semistructured Interview of At Risk Bipolar States (SIBARS) (Fusar-Poli et al., 2022) will be translated and validated in a Dutch sample, in cooperation with its creators, Prof. Dr. P. Fusar-Poli and colleagues.Detailed DescriptionSevere mental illnesses (SMI) distinguished as bipolar disorder and psychotic spectrum disorders, substantially impair patients' engagement in functional and occupational activities and severely limit social and societal functioning (GGZ Standaarden, 2022; NIH, 2022; NIMH, 2018). Based on the Dutch definition of SMI 1.7% of the national population suffers from an SMI (GGZ Standaarden, 2022). Despite this, time between first symptoms and accurate SMI diagnosis, can add up to more than 9.5 years in the case of bipolar disorders. For the psychotic spectrum, an early detection and intervention program (UHR) carried out by special EDI-Teams already exists, and has been found effective in limiting the transition to SMI with fifty percent. For bipolar disorders, no such program exists. This raises the question whether prodromal and subclinical symptoms of this disorder can be detected earlier and if transition into SMI can be limited. In light of current studies into the at-risk mental state, and the current development towards a possible transdiagnostic model for early detection and intervention of SMI (CHARMS-categories; (Liu et al., 2022)), the current study aims to contribute to limiting the transition into bipolar disorder. As a disturbance in circadian rhythm, as well as mood and anxiety symptoms are risk indicators for SMI in general and bipolar in specific, the current study evaluates an early intervention program for individuals at risk for developing an SMI, with a focus on bipolar symptomatology. Individuals at risk will answer questions from the SIBARS interview. As explained in a publication of Fusar-Poli et al. (2022), ""The Semi-structured Interview for Bipolar At Risk States (SIBARS) included a combination of several items adapted from well-established rating scales: (CAARMS (Yung et al., 2005); Hypomania Checklist-32 (Angst et al., 2005); Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (Altman et al., 1997); TEMPS-A questionnaire (Akiskal et al., 2005); QIDS-SR (Rush et al., 2003); Bergen Insomnia Scale (Pallesen et al., 2008); Idiopathic hypersomnia questionnaire (Vernet et al., 2010)). The SIBARS interview was developed for youths aged 15-35 and comprehended 5 domains: 1. Subtreshold Mania, 2. Depression, 3. Cyclothymic Features, 4. Genetic Risk, 5. Mood Swings. Subtreshold Mania, Depression and Mood Swings are continuous rating scales (that include a severity and frequency anchors), while Cyclothyimc Features and Genetic Risk are categorical scales (yes/no). The cut-offs allow assigning the specific subgroup of the BARS criteria: 1. Substreshold Mania, 2. Depression+Cyclothymic Features, 3. Depression+Genetic Risk, 4.

"Essential Thrombocythemia in Adolescents and Young Adults: Clinical Aspects, Treatment Options and Unmet Medical Needs","Iurlo, A.; Bucelli, C.; Cattaneo, D.","Current treatment of essential thrombocythemia (ET) should primarily prevent thrombo-hemorrhagic events, without increasing the rate of fibrotic progression or leukemic evolution, and secondarily control microvascular symptoms. Unlike other classic BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, ET is frequently diagnosed in adolescents and young adults (AYA), defined as individuals aged 15 to 39 years, in up to 20% of patients. However, since the current risk stratification of this disease is based on models, including that of ELN, IPSET-Thrombosis and its revised version, mainly applied to an older patients’ population, international guidelines are needed that specifically consider how to evaluate the prognosis of AYAs with ET. Furthermore, although ET is the most frequent MPN among AYA subjects, there is a lack of specific recommendations on how to treat it in this subgroup of patients, as management decisions are typically extrapolated from those for the elderly. Accordingly, since AYAs with ET represent a unique disease subset defined by attenuated genetic risk, more indolent phenotype, and longer survival than their older counterparts, treatment selection requires special attention to specific issues such as the risk of fibrotic/leukemic transformation, carcinogenicity, and fertility. This review article will provide a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and possible therapeutic approaches for AYA patients with ET, including antiplatelets/anticoagulants and cytoreductive agents, with a focus on pregnancy management in real-life clinical practice.",2023,,Current Treatment Options in Oncology,24,7,802-820,,10.1007/s11864-023-01099-8,,#1851,Iurlo 2023,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
The domain-variant indirect association between electrophysiological response to reward and ADHD presentations is moderated by dopaminergic polymorphisms,"Bunford, N.; Hámori, G.; Nemoda, Z.; Angyal, N.; Fiáth, R.; Sebők-Welker, T.É.; Pászthy, B.; Ulbert, I.; Réthelyi, J.M.","Background: Understanding the etiopathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may necessitate decomposition of the heterogeneous clinical phenotype into more homogeneous intermediate phenotypes. Reinforcement sensitivity is a promising candidate, but the exact nature of the ADHD-reward relation – including how, for whom, and to which ADHD dimensions atypicalities in reward processing are relevant – is equivocal. Methods: Aims were to examine, in a carefully phenotyped sample of adolescents (N = 305; Mage = 15.30 years, SD = 1.07; 39.7% girls), whether functional dopaminergic polymorphisms implicated in both reward processing and ADHD (1) are differentially associated with event-related potentials (ERPs) of reward anticipation at distinct levels of ADHD risk (nno risk = 174, nat-risk = 131, ndiagnosed = 83); and (2) moderate the indirect effect of dispositional affectivity on the association between ERPs and ADHD domains. Results: In adolescents at-risk for or with ADHD, carrying a hypodopaminergic allele was associated with enhanced ERPs of attention allocation to cue and attenuated ERPs of anticipatory attention to feedback. No associations were observed in adolescents not at-risk for or without ADHD. Controlling for age and sex, both the negative indirect effect of positive affectivity (PA) on the association between ERPs and inattention and the positive indirect effect of PA on the association between ERPs and hyperactivity/impulsivity were supported only for those with high activity dopamine transporter (DAT) alleles. Conclusions: Reward and affective processing are promising intermediate phenotypes relevant to disentangling ADHD developmental pathways.

"Association between maternal benzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic use in early pregnancy and the risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age: a nationwide, population-based cohort study in Taiwan","Meng, L.-C.; Lin, C.-W.; Lin, Y.-C.; Huang, S.-T.; Chen, Y.-Y.; Shang, C.-Y.; Wu, C.-Y.; Chen, L.-K.; Chan, K.A.; Hsiao, F.-Y.","Background: Benzodiazepines and Z-hypnotics are commonly prescribed for anxiety and insomnia during pregnancy, but the evidence regarding potential adverse neonatal outcomes is insufficient because of poor control for confounding factors in previous studies. We therefore aimed to evaluate the association between the use of benzodiazepines or Z-hypnotics during early pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age). Methods: We did a nationwide, population-based cohort study in Taiwan using three data sources: Taiwan's National Birth Certificate Application database, the National Health Insurance database, and the Maternal and Child Health Database. The study cohort included all singleton pregnancies of females aged 15–50 years who gave birth between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018. Pregnancies without valid information were excluded. Benzodiazepine and Z-hypnotic use was defined as at least one benzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic prescription during early pregnancy (the first 20 weeks of pregnancy). The primary outcomes were stillbirth (fetal death at or after 20 weeks’ gestation), preterm birth (<37 weeks’ gestation), and small for gestational age (birthweight below the 10th percentile for gestational age by sex). Logistic regression models with propensity score fine stratification weighting were used to control for potential confounders and examine the association between benzodiazepines or Z-hypnotics use during early pregnancy and the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were reported. We used confounding by indication control analyses, a sibling control study, and a paternal negative control design to account for unmeasured confounders. The risk associated with exposure during late pregnancy was also assessed. Findings: Between Oct 7, 2021, and June 10, 2022, we analysed the study data. The cohort included 2 882 292 singleton pregnancies; of which, 75 655 (2·6%) of the mothers were dispensed one or more benzodiazepines or Z-hypnotics during early pregnancy. Women exposed during pregnancy were older (mean age at delivery was 31·0 years [SD 5·3] for exposed women vs 30·6 years [4·9] for unexposed women), had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and were more likely to have unhealthy lifestyle behaviours than unexposed women. Information about ethnicity was not available. Early pregnancy exposure was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes compared with non-exposure. The propensity score-weighted OR was 1·19 (95% CI 1·10–1·28) for stillbirth, 1·19 (1·16–1·23) for preterm birth, and 1·16 (1·13–1·19) for small for gestational age. After controlling for confounding by indication, there was no significant association between drug exposure and stillbirth risk; however, this attenuation was not observed for preterm birth and small for gestational age. In models with sibling controls that accounted for familial confounding and genetic factors, early exposure to benzodiazepines or Z-hypnotics was not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth and preterm birth, but it remained significantly associated with small for gestational age. The paternal negative control analyses with point estimates close to the null indicated no strong evidence of unmeasured confounding shared by the mother and the father. Substantially increased risks of stillbirth and preterm birth were observed for late pregnancy exposure. Interpretation: Benzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic use in early pregnancy is not associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stillbirth and preterm birth after accounting for unmeasured confounding factors. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of small for gestational age and caution should be taken when prescribing these medications during late pregnancy.

Evaluation of Birth Weight and Neurodevelopmental Conditions Among Monozygotic and Dizygotic Twins,"Isaksson, J.; Ruchkin, V.; Ljungström, T.; Bölte, S.","Importance: Low birth weight is associated with an increased likelihood of neurodivergence and neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear whether birth weight contributes independently to NDCs or whether the association is predominantly driven by genetic predisposition. Objective: To estimate the associations between birth weight and dimensional (trait) and categorical (diagnoses) NDC outcomes, while adjusting for genetic risks. Design, Setting, and Participants: A co-twin design was applied to this case-control study conducted in Sweden. Diagnostic assessments were conducted between August 2011 and March 2022, within the Roots of Autism and ADHD Twin Study in Sweden (RATSS) during a 2.5-day participant visit to the clinic. The RATSS sample comprised phenotyped monozygotic and dizygotic twins enriched for NDCs. Data analysis was conducted in November 2022. Exposure: Birth weight. Main Outcomes and Measures: Categorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability were assessed. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted across and within twin pairs. Results: The study sample included 393 twins: 230 were monozygotic and 159 were dizygotic (zygosity was unknown for 4). Their median age was 15 (range, 8-37) years. There were 185 female participants (47.1%) and 208 male participants (52.9%). Across twin pairs, higher birth weight was associated with fewer autistic traits (unstandardized β [B], -5.51 [95% CI, -10.09 to -0.94]) and lower odds of autism diagnosis (OR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]) and intellectual disability (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92]). Within pairs, the association between birth weight and dimensional autism (B, -17.35 [95% CI, -28.66 to -6.04]) and categorical autism (OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.42]) remained among monozygotic pairs but not dizygotic pairs. In addition, higher birth weight was associated with lower odds of ADHD diagnosis (OR, 0.003 [95% CI, 0 to 0.70]), fewer ADHD traits (B, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.11]), and higher IQ ratings (B, 7.43 [95% CI, 1.05 to 13.82]) among monozygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this co-twin study suggest an association between low birth weight and NDCs, but they also acknowledge the importance of genetics because the associations observed were only statically significant among monozygotic twins.

Objective: To examine correlates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) across count-based severity groups (i.e., mild, moderate, mild-to-moderate, severe), identify specific diagnostic criteria indicative of greater severity, and evaluate whether the presence of specific criteria within mild-to-moderate AUD differentiates across relevant correlates and manifests in greater hazards of severe AUD development. Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Family-based study of individuals from seven sites across the United States. Participants: Cross-sectional (N=13,110; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [14.2] years) and longitudinal cohorts (N=2,818; mean baseline [SD] age, 16.1 [3.2] years) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). Exposure: N/A Main Outcomes and Measures: Sociodemographic, alcohol-related, psychiatric comorbidity (major depressive disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and other SUDs), brain electroencephalography (EEG), and AUD polygenic score measures as correlates of DSM-5 AUD levels (i.e., mild, moderate, severe) and criterion severity-defined “preaddiction” (i.e., low-risk vs. high-risk mild-to-moderate) AUD diagnostic groups. Results: Associations with alcohol-related, psychiatric, EEG, and AUD polygenic score measures reinforced the role of increasing criterion counts as indexing severity. Yet even within those meeting criteria for mild-to-moderate AUD (2-5 criteria), the presence of specific “high-risk” criteria (e.g., withdrawal) identified a group reporting heavier drinking and greater psychiatric comorbidity even after accounting for criterion count differences. In longitudinal analyses, prior mild-to-moderate AUD characterized by endorsement of at least one “high-risk” criterion outperformed other adolescent and young adult correlates of AUD progression (i.e., comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol involvement milestones) and was associated with more accelerated progression to severe AUD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 11.62; 95% CI, 7.54-17.92) compared to prior mild-to-moderate AUD without endorsement of “high-risk” criteria (aHR, 5.64; 95% CI, 3.28-9.70), independent of criterion count.

Here, we performed an integrative analysis using neuroimaging data from 58 PBD individuals and the Allen human brain transcriptomic dataset. We applied partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis on structural MRI data and cortical gene expression, enrichment and specific cell type analysis to investigate the genetic correlates of CT alterations in PBD. We found the expression levels of PBD-related genes showed significant spatial correlations with CT differences. Further enrichment and specific cell type analysis revealed that transcriptome signatures associated with cortical thinning were enriched in synaptic signaling, ion channels, astrocytes, and excitatory neurons. Neurodevelopmental patterns of these genes showed significantly increased expression in the cerebellum, cortex, and subcortical regions during the adolescence period. These results highlight neurodevelopmental transcriptional changes could account for most of the observed correlations with CT differences in PBD, which offers a novel perspective to understand biological conceptualization mechanisms for the genetic correlates of CT alterations.",2023,,Cerebral Cortex,33,12,7540-7552,,10.1093/cercor/bhad059,,#1861,Zhang 2023,"",""
Do polygenic indices capture “direct” effects on child externalizing behavior?

These externalizing behaviors often appear early in the life course and can have far-reaching consequences. Researchers have long been interested in direct measurements of genetic risk for externalizing behaviors, which can be incorporated alongside other known risk factors to improve efforts at early identification and intervention. In a preregistered analysis drawing on data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study (N=862 twins) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; N=2,824 parent-child trios), two longitudinal cohorts from the UK, we leveraged molecular genetic data and within-family designs to test for genetic effects on externalizing behavior that are unbiased by the common sources of environmental confounding. Results are consistent with the conclusion that an externalizing polygenic index (PGI) captures causal effects of genetic variants on externalizing problems in children and adolescents, with an effect size that is comparable to those observed for other established risk factors in the research literature on externalizing behavior. Additionally, we find that polygenic associations vary across development (peaking from age 5-10 years), that parental genetics (assortment and parent-specific effects) and family-level covariates affect prediction little, and that sex differences in polygenic prediction are present but only detectable using within-family comparisons.

Comparing Pruning and Thresholding with Continuous Shrinkage Polygenic Score Methods in a Large Sample of Ancestrally Diverse Adolescents from the ABCD Study®,"Ahern, J.; Thompson, W.; Fan, C.C.; Loughnan, R.","Using individuals’ genetic data researchers can generate Polygenic Scores (PS) that are able to predict risk for diseases, variability in different behaviors as well as anthropomorphic measures. This is achieved by leveraging models learned from previously published large Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) associating locations in the genome with a phenotype of interest. Previous GWASs have predominantly been performed in European ancestry individuals. This is of concern as PS generated in samples with a different ancestry to the original training GWAS have been shown to have lower performance and limited portability, and many efforts are now underway to collect genetic databases on individuals of diverse ancestries. In this study, we compare multiple methods of generating PS, including pruning and thresholding and Bayesian continuous shrinkage models, to determine which of them is best able to overcome these limitations. To do this we use the ABCD Study, a longitudinal cohort with deep phenotyping on individuals of diverse ancestry. We generate PS for anthropometric and psychiatric phenotypes using previously published GWAS summary statistics and examine their performance in three subsamples of ABCD: African ancestry individuals (n = 811), European ancestry Individuals (n = 6703), and admixed ancestry individuals (n = 3664).

Twin studies indicate that this co-occurrence is likely due to shared elements of risk, rather than reciprocal causation. A joint genome-wide investigation and pathway/network-based analysis of adolescent anxiety and pain problems can identify genetic pathways that subserve shared etiopathogenetic mechanisms. Pathway-based analyses were performed in the independent samples of: The Quebec Newborn Twin Study (QNTS; 246 twin pairs and 321 parents), the Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Quebec (QLSCD; n = 754), and in the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample. Multiple suggestive associations (p<1×10−5), and several enriched pathways were found after FDR correction for both phenotypes in the QNTS; many nominally-significant enriched pathways overlapped between pain problems and anxiety symptoms (uncorrected p<0.05) and yielded results consistent with previous studies of pain or anxiety. The QLSCD and the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample yielded similar findings. We replicated an association between the pathway involved in the regulation of myotube differentiation (GO:0010830) and both pain and anxiety problems in the QLSDC and the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample. Although limited by sample size and thus power, these data provide an initial support to conjoint molecular investigations of adolescent pain and anxiety problems.

Executive Control Training for Adolescents With ADHD: A Randomized Controlled,"","Brief SummaryThe goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate an evidence-based, non-pharmacological treatment alternative: Goal Management Training (GMT) for adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The main questions we aim to answer are: 1. Is GMT more effective than Treatment as Usual (TAU) in improving executive functioning in adolescents with ADHD? 2. Is GMT more effective than TAU in improving emotional health and social functioning in adolescents with ADHD? 3. Which clinical or cognitive characteristics are associated with treatment response? 4. Do medication, age, gender, and functional status at intake influence treatment response and long-term outcomes? 5. Are genetic (e.g. polygenic risk scores) and brain imaging data (e.g. estimates of brain maturation based on structural MRI or resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain connectivity) relevant clinical predictors for treatment response and long-term outcomes?Detailed DescriptionADHD is characterized by impaired executive functions (EFs). EFs are brain functions that allow us to direct our attention, retain relevant information, and ignore distractions in order to achieve our daily goals. Impairments in EF are associated with poorer academic achievement and vocational functioning, psychopathology symptoms, emotional and social problems, as well as lower quality of life in children and adolescents with ADHD. Furthermore, pharmacological treatment has not been shown to significantly improve EF difficulties, and there is still a considerable knowledge gap regarding the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Additionally, the research is often limited by short follow-up periods and few outcome measures. We propose a randomized controlled trial, comparing a seven-week non-pharmacological cognitive remediation program designed to improve EFs; Goal Management Training (GMT), to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for 120 adolescents with ADHD. The primary outcome is executive function behaviors in the school and home environments (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2, parent report). Secondary outcomes include neuropsychological tests, mental health, quality of life, and social deficit symptoms. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks, and 12- and 24 months post-treatment. In addition, we will collect biological samples and brain MRI data in a sub-sample, which will allow us to test whether genetic (e.g. polygenic scores) and brain imaging data collected at baseline (e.g. estimates of brain maturation based on structural MRI or resting-state fMRI brain connectivity) are relevant clinical predictors for treatment response and long-term outcomes. If sample size allows, these analyses will be purely exploratory, and the relevant measures will not be specified in this registration. The expected main benefit of the described study is to provide evidence-based non-pharmacological treatment to a vulnerable group, potentially improving life-long function and adherence to education, work, and social life. During the autumn of 2024, a qualitative interview will be conducted with a few participants who have completed GMT, and the co-therapists will participate in a focus group interview. The purpose is to complement the quantitative data from the main study with qualitative data on how GMT is experienced by participants and therapists.

This approach is particularly critical for understanding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which has unique public health importance given its early onset, high prevalence, individual variability, and causal association with co-occurring and later developing problems. A further priority concerns multi-disciplinary/multi-method datasets that can span different units of analysis. Here, we describe a public dataset using a case-control design for ADHD that includes: multi-method, multi-measure, multi-informant, multi-trait data, and multi-clinician evaluation and phenotyping.

This is a key property of the genomic architecture of psychiatric disorders and has been observed for rare and common genomic variants. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the microscale genetic overlap (pleiotropy) across psychiatric conditions and cognitive traits may lead to similar overlaps at the macroscale brain level such as large-scale brain functional networks. We took advantage of brain connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI to measure the effects of pleiotropy on large-scale brain networks, a putative step from genes to behaviour. We processed nine resting-state functional MRI datasets including 32 726 individuals and computed connectome-wide profiles of seven neuropsychiatric copy-number-variants, five polygenic scores, neuroticism and fluid intelligence as well as four idiopathic psychiatric conditions. Nine out of 19 pairs of conditions and traits showed significant functional connectivity correlations (rFunctional connectivity), which could be explained by previously published levels of genomic (rGenetic) and transcriptomic (rTranscriptomic) correlations with moderate to high concordance: rGenetic - rFunctional connectivity = 0.71 [0.40-0.87] and rTranscriptomic - rFunctional connectivity = 0.83 [0.52; 0.94]. Extending this analysis to functional connectivity profiles associated with rare and common genetic risk showed that 30 out of 136 pairs of connectivity profiles were correlated above chance. These similarities between genetic risks and psychiatric disorders at the connectivity level were mainly driven by the overconnectivity of the thalamus and the somatomotor networks. Our findings suggest a substantial genetic component for shared connectivity profiles across conditions and traits, opening avenues to delineate general mechanisms - amenable to intervention - across psychiatric conditions and genetic risks.",2023,,Brain,146,4,1686-1696,,10.1093/brain/awac315,,#1883,Moreau 2023,"",""
Neuroanatomical markers of familial risk in adolescents with conduct disorder and their unaffected relatives,"Fairchild, G.; Sully, K.; Passamonti, L.; Staginnus, M.; Darekar, A.; Sonuga-Barke, E.J.S.; Toschi, N.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported brain structure abnormalities in conduct disorder (CD), but it is unclear whether these neuroanatomical alterations mediate the effects of familial (genetic and environmental) risk for CD. We investigated brain structure in adolescents with CD and their unaffected relatives (URs) to identify neuroanatomical markers of familial risk for CD. METHODS: Forty-one adolescents with CD, 24 URs of CD probands, and 38 healthy controls (aged 12-18), underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. We performed surface-based morphometry analyses, testing for group differences in cortical volume, thickness, surface area, and folding. We also assessed the volume of key subcortical structures. RESULTS: The CD and UR groups both displayed structural alterations (lower surface area and folding) in left inferior parietal cortex compared with controls. In contrast, CD participants showed lower insula and pars opercularis volume than controls, and lower surface area and folding in these regions than controls and URs. The URs showed greater folding in rostral anterior cingulate and inferior temporal cortex than controls and greater medial orbitofrontal folding than CD participants. The surface area and volume differences were not significant when controlling for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. There were no group differences in subcortical volumes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that alterations in inferior parietal cortical structure partly mediate the effects of familial risk for CD. These structural changes merit investigation as candidate endophenotypes for CD. Neuroanatomical changes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex differentiated between URs and the other groups, potentially reflecting neural mechanisms of resilience to CD.",2023,,Psychological medicine,53,5,1721-1731,,10.1017/S0033291721003202,,#1884,Fairchild 2023,"",""
The associations of child screen time with psychiatric problems: the role of genetic confounding,"Zhang, Y.; Choi, K.W.; Delaney, S.W.; Ge, T.; Pingault, J.-B.; Tiemeier, H.","Importance: Children's exposure to screen time has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, yet the role of genetic factors in this association remains largely unknown. Objective: We examined (1) the longitudinal phenotypic association between child screen time and mental health outcomes and (2) the potential genetic confounding of this association. We hypothesized that genetics partially account for observed phenotypic associations. Design: Longitudinal (baseline and one-year follow-up) population-based cohort. Setting: Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development, 21 sites in the United States. Participants: This study included 4,262 children of genetically assigned European ancestry with mean age 9.9 years [SD = 0.6 years], 46.8% female. Exposure: Children’s daily screen time (in hours) was assessed both by child-report and parent-report questionnaires at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures: Child psychiatric problems, specifically attention and internalizing problems, were measured with the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist at the one-year follow-up. We used Genetic sensitivity analyses (Gsens), based on structural equation models using polygenic risk scores (PRS) of both exposure and outcomes, and either single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability or twin-based heritability to estimate genetic confounding of associations between child screen time and attention or internalizing problems, separately. Results: We found that child screen time was positively associated with the different psychiatric problems. Further, the television time PRS was associated with child screen time (β=0.18 SD, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.23); the ADHD PRS was associated with attention problems (β=0.13 SD, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.16); and the depression PRS was associated with internalizing problems (β=0.10 SD, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.13). These PRSs were associated with cross-traits, suggesting genetic confounding. Using PRSs and SNP-based heritability, we estimated that genetic confounding entirely accounts for the association between child screen time and attention problems, and moderately (42.7%) accounts for the association between child screen time and internalizing problems. When PRSs and twin-based heritability estimates were used, genetic confounding fully explained both associations. Conclusions and Relevance: Genetic confounding may explain a substantial part of the associations between child screen time and psychiatric problems.

In this paper, we reflected on the current constraints that make early interventions for pediatric OCD unpromoted and reviewed the approaches with potential application for early identification and early intervention in pediatric OCD, categorized by three-level prevention stages corresponding to a clinical staging model. Since the etiology of pediatric OCD is still unclear, primary prevention is most lacking, and early interventions for pediatric OCD are currently focused on the secondary prevention stage, which aims to prevent the conversion of obsessive-compulsive symptoms into full-blown OCD; tertiary prevention mostly focuses on the alleviation of mild to moderate OCD, while interventions for co-morbidities are still in their infancy.

A retrospective examination of previously published ADHD GWAS results confirmed an un-reported, small but statistically significant effect of TTLL11 on ADHD. The imaging genetics study replicated this association and showed that the TTLL11 gene was associated with resting state activity and connectivity of the somatomoter network, and can be predicted by dorsal attention network connectivity. Specifically, the GG homozygotes showed lower brain activity, weaker brain network connectivity, and non-significant brain-attention association compared to the A allele carriers.

PWS has three molecular genetic classes. The most common defect is due to a paternal 15q11-q13 deletion observed in about 60% of individuals.

Mild cognitive impairment and behavior problems in PWS include self-injury, anxiety, compulsions, and outbursts in childhood, impacted by genetic subtypes. Food seeking and hyperphagia can lead to morbid obesity and contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular or orthopedic problems. The control of hyperphagia and improving food-related behaviors are the most important unmet needs in PWS and could be addressed with the development of a new therapeutic agent, as currently no approved therapeutics exist for PWS treatment.

Experiencing multiple types of traumas appears to be common during childhood, and even more so during adolescence. Dramatic brain/body transformations occurring during adolescence may provide a highly responsive substrate to external stimuli and lead to trauma-related vulnerability conditions, such as internalizing (anxiety, depression, anhedonia, withdrawal) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency, conduct disorders) problems. Analyzing relations among neuronal, endocrine, immune, and biochemical signatures of trauma and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, including the role of personality traits in shaping these conducts, this review highlights that the marked effects of traumatic experience on the brain/body involve changes at nearly every level of analysis, from brain structure, function and connectivity to endocrine and immune systems, from gene expression (including in the gut) to the development of personality.",2023,,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,145,"(Laricchiuta D., daniela.laricchiuta@unipg.it) Department of Philosophy, Social Sciences & Education, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy(Panuccio A.; Picerni E.; Petrosini L.)

The combination of autism and exceptional cognitive ability is associated with suicidal ideation,"Casten, L.G.; Thomas, T.R.; Doobay, A.F.; Foley-Nicpon, M.; Kramer, S.; Nickl-Jockschat, T.; Abel, T.; Assouline, S.; Michaelson, J.J.","Autism with co-occurring exceptional cognitive ability is often accompanied by severe internalizing symptoms and feelings of inadequacy. Whether cognitive ability also translates into greater risk for suicidal ideation is unclear. To investigate this urgent question, we examined two samples of high-ability autistic individuals for factors that were predictive of suicidal ideation. In the first sample (N = 1,074 individuals seen at a clinic specializing in gifted/talented youth), we observed a striking excess of parent-reported suicidal ideation in autistic individuals with IQ ≥ 120 (Odds Ratio = 5.9, p=0.0007). In a separate sample of SPARK participants, we confirmed higher rates of suicidal thoughts compared to non-autistic children from the ABCD cohort (combined N = 16,049, Odds Ratio = 6.8, p<2.2e-16), and further that autistic children with suicidal thoughts had significantly higher cognitive ability (p<2.2e-16) than those without. Elevated polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive performance were associated with increased suicidal thoughts (N = 1,983, Z=2.16,p=0.03), with PGS for educational attainment trending in the same direction (Z=1.4,p=0.17). Notably, similar results were found in parents of these autistic youth, where higher PGS for educational attainment was associated with increasing thoughts of suicide (N = 736, Z=2.28,p=0.02).

DSRD often occurs in late adolescence. There is a sudden onset of language disorders, loss of autonomy and daily living skills, as well as behavioral symptoms such as depression, psychosis, or catatonia. These symptoms are non-specific and lead to an overlap with other diagnostic categories, thus complicating diagnosis. The etiologies of the syndrome are not clearly identified but certain predispositions of patients with trisomy 21 have suggested an underlying immune-mediated mechanism.

Fatty liver disease in children (MAFLD/PeFLD Type 2): unique classification considerations and challenges,"Hegarty, R.; Kyrana, E.; Fitzpatrick, E.; Dhawan, A.","In children, fatty liver disease is a group of disorders that often overlaps with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), which requires prompt diagnosis and specific management. Metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) or, formerly, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic component of a multisystemic disease that requires a positive criteria in metabolic dysfunction for diagnosis. However, in children, the diagnosis of MAFLD is one of the exclusions of an IMD [paediatric fatty liver disease (PeFLD) type 1] including the possibility that an IMD can be identified in the future following investigations that may be negative at the time. Therefore, while children with fatty liver with metabolic dysfunction could be classified as MAFLD (PeFLD type 2) and managed that way, those who do not fulfil the criteria for metabolic dysfunction should be considered separately bearing in mind the possibility of identifying a yet undiagnosed IMD (PeFLD type 3). This concept is ever more important in a world where MAFLD is the most common cause of liver disease in children and adolescents in whom about 7% are affected. The disease is only partially understood, and awareness is still lacking outside hepatology and gastroenterology. Despite its increasing pervasiveness, the management is far from a one-size-fits-all. Increasing complexities around the genetic, epigenetic, non-invasive modalities of assessment, psychosocial impacts, therapeutics, and natural history of the disease have meant that an individualised approach is required. This is where the challenge lies so that children with fatty liver are considered on their own merits.

"Reward, motivation and brain imaging in human healthy participants – A narrative review","Weinstein, A.M.","Over the past 20 years there has been an increasing number of brain imaging studies on the mechanisms underlying reward motivation in humans. This narrative review describes studies on the neural mechanisms associated with reward motivation and their relationships with cognitive function in healthy human participants. The brain’s meso-limbic dopamine reward circuitry in humans is known to control reward-motivated behavior in humans. The medial and lateral Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC) integrate motivation and cognitive control during decision-making and the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) integrates and transmits signals of reward to the mesolimbic and meso-cortical dopamine circuits and initiates motivated behavior. The thalamus and insula influence incentive processing in humans and the motor system plays a role in response to action control. There are reciprocal relationships between reward motivation, learning, memory, imagery, working memory, and attention. The most common method of assessing reward motivation is the monetary incentive delay task (DMRT) and there are several meta-analyses of this paradigm. Genetics modulates motivation reward, and dopamine provides the basis for the interaction between motivational and cognitive control. There is some evidence that male adolescents take more risky decisions than female adolescents and that the lateralization of reward-related DA release in the ventral striatum is confined to men. These studies have implications for our understanding of natural reward and psychiatric conditions like addiction, depression and ADHD. Furthermore, the association between reward and memory can help develop treatment techniques for drug addiction that interfere with consolidation of memory. Finally, there is a lack of research on reward motivation, genetics and sex differences and this can improve our understanding of the relationships between reward, motivation and the brain.",2023,,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,17,"(Weinstein A.M., avivwe@ariel.ac.il) Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Ariel University, Ari’el, Israel",,,10.3389/fnbeh.2023.1123733,,#1922,Weinstein 2023,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
Can type 1 diabetes be an unexpected complication of obesity?,"Oboza, P.; Ogarek, N.; Olszanecka-Glinianowicz, M.; Kocelak, P.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic autoimmune diseases, characterized by absolute insulin deficiency caused via inflammatory destruction of the pancreatic β-cell. Genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors play a role in the development of diseases. Almost ⅕ of cases involve people under the age of 20. In recent years, the incidence of both T1D and obesity has been increasing, especially among children, adolescents, and young people. In addition, according to the latest study, the prevalence of overweight or obesity in people with T1D has increased significantly. The risk factors of weight gain included using exogenous insulin, intensifying insulin therapy, fear of hypoglycemia and related decrease in physical activity, and psychological factors, such as emotional eating and binge eating. It has also been suggested that T1D may be a complication of obesity. The relationship between body size in childhood, increase in body mass index values in late adolescence and the development of T1D in young adulthood is considered. Moreover, the coexistence of T1D and T2D is increasingly observed, this situation is called double or hybrid diabetes.

"Brain and molecular mechanisms underlying the nonlinear association between close friendships, mental health, and cognition in children","Shen, C.; Rolls, E.T.; Xiang, S.; Langley, C.; Sahakian, B.J.; Cheng, W.; Feng, J.","Close friendships are important for mental health and cognition in late childhood. However, whether the more close friends the better, and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmental study, we identified nonlinear associations between the number of close friends, mental health, cognition, and brain structure. Although few close friends were associated with poor mental health, low cognitive functions, and small areas of the social brain (e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula, and the temporoparietal junction), increasing the number of close friends beyond a level (around 5) was no longer associated with better mental health and larger cortical areas, and was even related to lower cognition. In children having no more than five close friends, the cortical areas related to the number of close friends revealed correlations with the density of μ-opioid receptors and the expression of OPRM1 and OPRK1 genes, and could partly mediate the association between the number of close friends, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and crys-talized intelligence. Longitudinal analyses showed that both too few and too many close friends at baseline were associated with more ADHD symptoms and lower crystalized intelligence 2 y later.

Tinea pedis: an updated review,"Leung, A.K.C.; Barankin, B.; Lam, J.M.; Leong, K.F.; Hon, K.L.","Background: Tinea pedis is one of the most common superficial fungal infections of the skin, with various clinical manifestations. This review aims to familiarize physicians with the clinical features, diagnosis and management of tinea pedis. Methods: A search was conducted in April 2023 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key terms 'tinea pedis' OR 'athlete's foot'. The search strategy included all clinical trials, observational studies and reviews published in English within the past 10 years. Results: Tinea pedis is most often caused by Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton interdigitale. It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population have tinea pedis. The prevalence is higher in adolescents and adults than in children. The peak age incidence is between 16 and 45 years of age. Tinea pedis is more common amongst males than females. Transmission amongst family members is the most common route, and transmission can also occur through indirect contact with contaminated belongings of the affected patient. Three main clinical forms of tinea pedis are recognized: interdigital, hyperkeratotic (moccasin-type) and vesiculobullous (inflammatory). The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis is low. A KOH wet-mount examination of skin scrapings of the active border of the lesion is recommended as a point-of-care testing. The diagnosis can be confirmed, if necessary, by fungal culture or culture-independent molecular tools of skin scrapings. Superficial or localized tinea pedis usually responds to topical antifungal therapy. Oral antifungal therapy should be reserved for severe disease, failed topical antifungal therapy, concomitant presence of onychomycosis or in immunocompromised patients. Conclusion: Topical antifungal therapy (once to twice daily for 1-6 weeks) is the mainstay of treatment for superficial or localized tinea pedis. Examples of topical antifungal agents include allylamines (e.g. terbinafine), azoles (e.g. ketoconazole), benzylamine, ciclopirox, tolnaftate and amorolfine. Oral antifungal agents used for the treatment of tinea pedis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole. Combined therapy with topical and oral antifungals may increase the cure rate.

Causal associations between gut microbiota and regional cortical structure: a Mendelian randomization study,"Zhou, M.; Chen, S.; Chen, Y.; Wang, C.; Chen, C.","Introduction: Observational studies have reported associations between gut microbiota composition and central nervous system diseases. However, the potential causal relationships and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effects of gut microbiota on cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (TH) in the brain. Methods: We used genome-wide association study summary statistics of gut microbiota abundance in 18,340 individuals from the MiBioGen Consortium to identify genetic instruments for 196 gut microbial taxa. We then analyzed data from 56,761 individuals from the ENIGMA Consortium to examine associations of genetically predicted gut microbiota with alterations in cortical SA and TH globally and across 34 functional brain regions. Inverse-variance weighted analysis was used as the primary MR method, with MR Egger regression, MR-PRESSO, Cochran’s Q test, and leave-one-out analysis to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results: At the functional region level, genetically predicted higher abundance of class Mollicutes was associated with greater SA of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (β = 8.39 mm2, 95% CI: 3.08–13.70 mm2, p = 0.002), as was higher abundance of phylum Tenericutes (β = 8.39 mm2, 95% CI: 3.08–13.70 mm2, p = 0.002). Additionally, higher abundance of phylum Tenericutes was associated with greater SA of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (β = 10.51 mm2, 95% CI: 3.24–17.79 mm2, p = 0.0046). No evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy was detected. Conclusion: Specific gut microbiota may causally influence cortical structure in brain regions involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.

While individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDel) are at increased genetic risk for psychosis, initial evidence suggests that they have strikingly low rates of substance use. In the current study, we aimed to directly compare substance use patterns and their neurobehavioral correlates in genetic and clinical high-risk cohorts. Methods Data on substance use frequency and severity, clinical symptoms and neurobehavioral measures were collected at baseline and at 12-month follow-up visits in two prospective longitudinal cohorts: participants included 89 22qDel carriers and 65 age and sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls (40.67% male, Mage=19.26 ± 7.84 years) and 1288 CHR-P youth and 371 matched TD controls from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study-2 and 3 (55.74% male; Mage=18.71 ± 4.27 years). Data were analyzed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally using linear mixed models. Results Controlling for age, sex, and site, CHR-P individuals had significantly elevated rates of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use relative to TD controls, whereas 22qDel had significantly lower rates. Increased substance use frequency and severity in CHR-P individuals was associated with increased positive psychosis symptom severity, dysphoric mood, social functioning, and IQ, while higher social anhedonia was associated with lower substance use frequency and severity, across all domains at baseline. These patterns persisted when we investigated these relationships longitudinally over one-year. CHR-P youth exhibited significantly increased positive psychosis symptoms, dysphoric mood, social anhedonia, and IQ compared to 22qDel carriers, and significantly higher social functioning and lower rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to 22qDel carriers, both at baseline and at one year follow-up. Conclusions Individuals at genetic and clinical high risk for psychosis have strikingly different patterns of substance use.

Methods: After recruiting 87 MDD patients and 53 healthy controls, we compared demographic and baseline clinical characteristics. The Childhood Chronic Stress Questionnaire was used to assess stress caused by early-life events. MDD patients underwent six weeks of treatment, and response to treatment was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. In addition, four MDD patients and five controls were randomly chosen for genome-wide methylation analysis. Results: The gene RPS6KA5 showed significant methylation differences between the two groups. Severity of chronic childhood stress was significantly associated with increased risk of depression in adolescents, but not with treatment response.

Its etiology is largely unknown, but twin studies suggest that it is moderately heritable. In this study, we pooled phenotypic and genomic data from seven international cohorts (N = 27,537 individuals) and conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported hoarding symptoms (HS). We followed up the results with gene-based and gene-set analyses, as well as leave-one-out HS polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. To examine a possible genetic association between hoarding symptoms and other phenotypes we conducted cross-trait PRS analyses. Though we did not report any genome-wide significant SNPs, we report heritability estimates for the twin-cohorts between 26–48%, and a SNP-heritability of 11% for an unrelated sub-cohort. Cross-trait PRS analyses showed that the genetic risk for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder were significantly associated with hoarding symptoms. We also found suggestive evidence for an association with educational attainment. There were no significant associations with other phenotypes previously linked to HD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Preliminary studies on apparent mendelian psychotic disorders in consanguineous families,"Kanwal, A.; Sheikh, S.A.; Iftikhar, A.; Naz, S.; Pardo, J.V.","Background: Psychiatric disorders are characterized by alteration in emotions, mood and behavior. Genetics is known to play a significant role in the development of psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with psychiatric illnesses. We hypothesize the existence of rare variants following Mendelian recessive mode of inheritance. These variants can be identified in families with multiple affected individuals born to unaffected consanguineous parents. Methods: We visited psychiatric outpatient departments of multiple hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. We focused on psychosis, as it can occur in several DSM disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia and bipolar disorder. After clinical diagnosis by an American trained psychiatrist, detailed clinical assessments using Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS), Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis and Affective Disorders (DI-PAD), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-D; HAM-A) were administered to all willing affected and unaffected participants. Results: We identified eight pedigrees with two or more psychotic individuals in each family. Clinical diagnoses determined by their psychiatrists included ten individuals with schizophrenia; four individuals with psychosis and bipolar disorder; and two patients with “unspecified psychosis.” The rating instruments rigorously confirmed the diagnosis of psychosis in the affected patients from the six families as well as the absence of psychotic disorders in unaffected individuals from the six families. We obtained DNA samples from willing members of all eight families for future genetic analyses. Conclusion: Our research highlights an alternative approach to discovery of rare recessively inherited genetic variants causing psychiatric disorders that have remained unidentified to date. These findings could illuminate underlying biological mechanisms leading toward development of targeted therapies in future.",2022,,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,,,10.1186/s12888-022-04304-4,,#1947,Kanwal 2022,"",For Mahnoor's review?
Update on Central Hypersomnia Disorders in Children,"Kotagal, S.","Purposeof Review: To provide an update on central hypersomnia disorders in children because they are distinct from those seen in adults. Recent Findings: Despite its striking clinical features, there are delays in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, especially in pre-school age children. The delay in diagnosis and instituting timely and appropriate management may contribute to adverse psychosocial consequences. Comorbidities of narcolepsy include depression, anxiety, precocious puberty, and obesity. Autonomic dysfunction is often present in adolescents at the onset of narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia, but may go unrecognized. It shows a female preponderance and can complicate management. There have been advances in pharmacological therapy of hypersomnia disorders, but challenges remain as some pediatric formulations have not received official regulatory approval. Though we now have a better understanding of the immunology of narcolepsy type 1, the current management is largely symptomatic in nature. Summary: There is a need for early recognition and diagnosis of central hypersomnia disorders of childhood. There are significant comorbidities which can impact the quality of life. Pharmacological treatment efforts remain mainly on an “off-label” basis because many drugs have not received official regulatory approval for use in children.",2022,,Current Sleep Medicine Reports,8,4,160-167,,10.1007/s40675-022-00237-2,,#1948,Kotagal 2022,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

However, it is unknown whether early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the number of depressive and psychotic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Using the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents birth cohort (N = up-to 6401), we have examined longitudinal associations of early-life inflammation [exposures: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9y; IL-6 and CRP DNA-methylation (DNAm) scores at birth and age 7y; and IL-6 and CRP polygenic risk scores (PRSs)] with the number of depressive episodes and psychotic experiences (PEs) between ages 10–28 years. Psychiatric outcomes were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and Psychotic Like Symptoms Questionnaires, respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were tested using negative binomial models, which were adjusted for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Serum IL-6 levels at age 9y were associated with the total number of depressive episodes between 10 and 28y in the base model (n = 4835; β = 0.066; 95%CI:0.020–0.113; pFDR = 0.041) which was weaker when adjusting for metabolic and sociodemographic factors. Weak associations were observed between inflammatory markers (serum IL-6 and CRP DNAm scores) and total number of PEs. Other inflammatory markers were not associated with depression or PEs. Early-life inflammatory markers are associated with the burden of depressive episodes and of PEs subsequently from childhood to adulthood.

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in children with monogenic glucokinase-related diabetes (GCK-MD) and evaluate their association with quality of life (QoL). Methods: The study invited children with GCK-MD aged 5–18 years identified in the Central National Registry and treated in 3 pediatric diabetes centers in Poland. The control group comprised children with type 1 diabetes (T1D, the most common diabetes type in youth) matched for age and family history of diabetes. Participants underwent a semistructured clinical interview diagnostic for psychiatric comorbidities, questionnaires assessing behavioral problems, depressive symptoms, parental stress, and measuring general and diabetes-related QoL (PedsQl).

Blood interleukin levels, which regulate inflammation, have been linked to aggression and internalizing behaviors. We performed a hypothesis-driven genetic study to (1) evaluate the association of IL1B, IL2, and IL6 gene variants with aggression and internalizing behaviors and (2) explore gene–environment interactions with childhood adversity in a deeply phenotyped childhood-onset aggression sample including 255 cases and 226 controls of European ancestry. Methods: We evaluated the association of putative functional and tag SNPs within IL1B, IL2, and IL6 with aggression case status, parent-reported internalizing problems, self-reported anxiety symptoms, and self-reported depressive symptoms in our sample. We also performed exploratory GxE analyses within cases, testing for statistical interaction between interleukin SNP genotype and childhood adversity for depressive symptoms. Results: No significant association was observed between any of the interleukin SNPs and childhood-onset aggression. We observed association of IL6 variant rs2069827 with depressive symptoms (p = 7.15×10–4), and trends for an interaction between severe childhood adversity and SNPs in IL1B and IL2 for depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that common variation in IL6 may be associated with depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, and that common variation in interleukin genes may sensitize individuals to the depressogenic effects of traumatic life experiences.

PGS for problematic alcohol use, externalizing, and smoking quantity were associated with alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and nicotine dependence, respectively (OR = 1.11–1.33). PGS for problematic alcohol use and externalizing were also associated with any substance dependence (ORs = 1.09–1.18). The full model explained 6–13% of the variance in SUDs. Those in the top 10% of CERI and PGS had relative risk ratios of 3.86–8.04 for each SUD relative to the bottom 90%. Overall, the combined measures of clinical, environmental, and genetic risk demonstrated modest ability to distinguish between affected and unaffected individuals in young adulthood.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with children aged 6–18 in rural schools in southwest China using a survey questionnaire. The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire-IV (SNAP-IV) was used to measure ADHD symptoms, and standardized questions about urination and defecation were used to measure lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and functional defecation disorders (FDDs). The association of ADHD with LUTS and FDDs was analyzed by matched logistic regression after propensity score matching was performed to minimize the influence of potential confounders, including demographic characteristics. Results: A total of 17,279 participants were included in the analyses. The prevalence of ADHD was 2 % mainly among boys before age 12, after which it showed a decreasing trend with age, resulting in a concomitant reduction in gender differences. The risk of ADHD was positively associated with the presence of enuresis, holding maneuvers, intermittency, and encopresis, with encopresis having the strongest association (P = 0.001). The presence of holding maneuvers, intermittency, excessive volitional stool retention, and encopresis were associated with a higher risk of ADHD at 6–15 years-old, with intermittency exhibiting an increasingly positive association with ADHD risk across ages 6–15.

We now have transcriptomic data (mRNA-seq) from a random subset of 4,543 of these young adults. SES in the household-of-origin and in young adulthood were examined as covariates of a priori-defined mRNA-based disease signatures and of specific gene transcripts identified de novo. An SES composite from young adulthood predicted many disease signatures, as did income and subjective status. Analyses highlighted SES-based inequalities in immune, inflammatory, ribosomal, and metabolic pathways, several of which play central roles in senescence. Many genes are also involved in transcription, translation, and diverse signaling mechanisms.

Although risk for EDs reflects both genetic and neurobiological factors, knowledge of how genetic risk for EDs relates to neurobiology and psychiatric symptoms during critical developmental periods remains limited. We therefore implemented a novel multivariate framework, which sought to advance knowledge of the etiology of EDs by simultaneously estimating associations between genetic risk, brain structure and ED-related psychopathology symptoms in over 4,500 adolescents of European ancestry from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (M(SD)age=119.29(7.49) months). Polygenic scores for anorexia nervosa (AN PGS) and body mass index (BMI PGS) were generated and related to three morphometric brain features—cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical grey matter volume—and to latent psychopathology factors using structural equation modeling. We identified a three-factor structure of ED-related psychopathology symptoms: eating, distress and fear factors. Increased BMI PGS were uniquely associated with greater eating factor scores, whereas AN PGS were unrelated to psychopathology factors. Moreover, genetic risk for high BMI and for AN had distinct neural correlates, where greater BMI PGS predicted widespread increases in cortical thickness and reductions in surface area while AN PGS were nominally related to reduced caudate volume. Altered default mode and visual network thickness was associated with greater eating factor scores, whereas distress and fear factor scores reflected a shared reduction in somatomotor network thickness. Our novel findings indicate that greater genetic risk for high BMI and altered cortical thickness of canonical brain networks underpin ED symptomatology in early adolescence.

Conclusion: There were 9 SNPs significantly correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms in children with ADHD, and the rs1410739 (OBI1-AS1 locus) may provide a new direction for ADHD research. Our study builds on previous susceptibility research and further investigates the impact of a single SNP on the severity of clinical symptoms of ADHD.

Polygenic risk scores for antisocial behavior in relation to amygdala morphology across an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder case-control sample with and without disruptive behavior,"Kleine Deters, R.; Ruisch, I.H.; Faraone, S.V.; Hartman, C.A.; Luman, M.; Franke, B.; Oosterlaan, J.; Buitelaar, J.K.; Naaijen, J.; Dietrich, A.; Hoekstra, P.J.","Antisocial and aggressive behaviors show considerable heritability and are central to disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), but are also frequently observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While the amygdala is implicated as a key neural structure, it remains unclear whether common genetic variants underlie this brain-behavior association. We hypothesized that polygenic (risk) scores for antisocial and aggressive behaviors (ASB-PRS) would be related to amygdala morphology. Using the Broad Antisocial Behavior Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS; mostly population based cohorts), we calculated ASB-PRS in the NeuroIMAGE I ADHD case-control sample with varying levels of DBD symptomatology (n=679 from 379 families, aged 7 – 29). We first investigated associations of several ASB-PRS p value thresholds with the presence of DBD symptoms and self-reported antisocial behavior (ASB) to determine the threshold for further analyses. This PRS was then related to amygdala volume and shape using regression and vertex-wise analyses. Our results showed associations of ASB-PRS with the presence of DBD symptoms, self-reported ASB, and left basolateral amygdala shape, independent of ADHD symptom severity and ADHD-PRS, with a relative outward displacement of the vertices. No associations of ASB-PRS, DBD symptoms or self-reported ASB with amygdala volume were found. Our results indicate that genetic risk for antisocial and aggressive behaviors is related to amygdala shape alterations, and point to genetic sharing across different DBD and ASB and aggression-related phenotypes as a spectrum of genetically related quantitative traits.

Genomic testing is increasingly recommended as a first-line investigation for these children. We aim to determine the effect of genomics, inheritance, and socioeconomic deprivation on neuropsychiatric risk in children with intellectual disability of genetic origin as compared with the general population. Methods: IMAGINE is a prospective cohort study using online mental health and medical assessments in a cohort of 3407 UK participants with intellectual disability and pathogenic genomic variants as identified by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Our study is on a subset of these participants, including all children aged 4–19 years. We collected diagnostic genomic reports from NHS records and asked primary caregivers to provide an assessment of their child using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System 3 (ABAS-3), and a medical history questionnaire. Each child was assigned a rank based on their postcode using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD). We compared the IMAGINE cohort with the 2017 National Survey of Children's Mental Health in England. The main outcomes of interest were mental health and neurodevelopment according to the DAWBA and SDQ. Findings: We recruited 2770 children from the IMAGINE study between Oct 1, 2014 and June 30, 2019, of whom 2397 (86·5%) had a basic assessment of their mental health completed by their families and 1277 (46·1%) completed a medical history questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 9·2 years (SD 3·9); 1339 (55·9%) were boys and 1058 (44·1%) were girls. 355 (27·8%) of 1277 reported a seizure disorder and 814 (63·7%) reported movement or co-ordination problems. 1771 (73·9%) of 2397 participants had a pathogenic copy number variant (CNV) and 626 (26·1%) had a pathogenic single nucleotide variant (SNV). Participants were representative of the socioeconomic spectrum of the UK general population. The relative risk (RR) of co-occurring neuropsychiatric diagnoses, compared with the English national population, was high: autism spectrum disorder RR 29·2 (95% CI 23·9–36·5), ADHD RR 13·5 (95% CI 11·1–16·3). In children with a CNV, those with a familial variant tended to live in more socioeconomically deprived areas than those with a de novo variant. Both inheritance and socioeconomic deprivation contributed to neuropsychiatric risk in those with a CNV. Interpretation: Children with genomic variants and intellectual disability are at an increased risk of neuropsychiatric difficulties. CNV variant inheritance and socioeconomic deprivation also contribute to the risk. Early genomic investigations of children with intellectual disability could facilitate the identification of the most vulnerable children. Additionally, harnessing parental expertise using online DAWBA assessments could rapidly identify children with exceptional needs to child mental health services.

Cholecystokinin B receptor gene polymorphism (rs2941026) is associated with anxious personality and suicidal thoughts in a longitudinal study,"Lvovs, A.; Matrov, D.; Kurrikoff, T.; Veidebaum, T.; Harro, J.","Objectives: Cholecystokinin is a neuropeptide with a role in the neurobiology of adaptive behaviour that is implicated in anxiety disorders, while the underlying mechanisms currently remain insufficiently explained. The rs2941026 variation in the cholecystokinin B receptor gene has previously been associated with trait anxiety. Our aim was to investigate associations between the CCKB receptor gene polymorphism rs2941026 with anxiety, personality, depressiveness and suicidality in a longitudinal study of late adolescence and early adulthood. Methods: We used reports on trait and state anxiety, depressiveness and suicidal thoughts, as well as Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales, from the two birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality, Behaviour and Health Study. We measured associations between the CCKBR gene rs2941026 and anxiety-related phenotypes both longitudinally and cross-sectionally at ages 15, 18, 25 and 33. Results: Homozygosity for both alleles of the CCKBR rs2941026 was associated with higher trait and state anxiety in the longitudinal analysis. Cross-sectional comparisons were statistically significant at ages 18 and 25 for trait anxiety and at ages 25 and 33 for state anxiety. Higher depressiveness and suicidal thoughts were associated with the A/A genotype at age 18. Additionally, homozygosity for the A-allele was related to higher FEAR and SADNESS in the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales. The genotype effects were more apparent in females, who displayed higher levels of negative affect overall. Conclusions: CCKBR genotype is persistently associated with negative affect in adolescence and young adulthood.

Endocannabinoid-dependent persistent decrease of GABAergic transmission on dopaminergic neurons underlies gene-environment interaction-induced susceptibility to cocaine sensitization,"Serra, V.; Traccis, F.; Aroni, S.; Bortolato, M.; Melis, M.","Vulnerability to develop cocaine use disorder depends upon an unpredictable combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Early life adversity and adolescence are critical non-genetic risk factors, and haplotypes of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) genes are among genetic variations increasing the risk of drug-related problems. However, data on the interactions between inheritable risk factors and early life stress (ES) with respect to predisposition to cocaine abuse are limited. Here, we show that a mouse model containing both genetic (low-activity alleles of the MAO A gene; MAOANeo) and environmental (i.e., ES) variables displays a long lasting increased sensitivity to repeated in vivo cocaine psychomotor stimulant actions associated with a reduction of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-dependent form of short-term plasticity, also becomes readily expressed by dopamine neurons from MAOANeoES mice treated repeatedly with cocaine. Activation of either dopamine D2 or CB1 receptors is required for cocaine-induced DSI expression, decreased GABA synaptic efficacy, and hyperlocomotion. Next, in vivo pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG signaling during repeated cocaine exposure occludes its actions both in vivo and ex vivo. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by this gene by environment interaction in VTA dopamine neurons of male pre-adolescent mice, contributing to our understanding of neural mechanisms of vulnerability for early onset cocaine use disorder.",2022,,bioRxiv,,"(Serra V.; Traccis F.; Aroni S.; Melis M., myriam@unica.it) Department of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Cagliari, Italy(Bortolato M.)

We aim to explore the shared etiology, via lifecourse adiposity, between T2D and depression. Methods: We used data from birth until 46years from Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 6,372; 53.8% females). We conducted multivariate analyses on three outcomes: T2D (4.2%), depression (19.2%) and as comorbidity (1.8%). We conducted (i) Path analysis to clarify time-dependent body mass index (BMI) related pathways, including BMI polygenic risk scores (PRS); and (ii) Cox regression models to assess whether reduction of overweight between 7years and 31years influence T2D, depression and/or comorbidity. The models were tested for covariation with sex, education, smoking, physical activity, and diet score. Results: The odd ratios (OR) of T2D in individuals with depression was 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34–2.11], and no change in estimate was observed when adjusted for covariates. T2D and comorbidity showed similar patterns of relationships in the path analyses (P < 0.001). The genetic risk for obesity (PRS BMI) did not show direct effect on T2D or comorbidity in adulthood but indirectly through measures of adiposity in early childhood and mid-adulthood in the path analysis (P < 0.001). Having early-onset of overweight at 7years and 31years showed highest risk of T2D (OR 3.8, 95%CI 2.4–6.1) and comorbidity (OR 5.0, 95%CI 2.7–9.5), with mild-to-moderate attenuation with adjustments. Depression showed no significant associations. Conclusions: We found evidence for overweight since childhood as a risk factor for T2D and co-morbidity between T2D and depression, influenced moderately by lifestyle factors in later life.

We assessed whether ML provided added value over logistic regression for prediction of schizophrenia, and compared models built using polygenic risk scores (PRS) or clinical/demographic factors. LASSO and ridge-penalised logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, boosting, neural networks and stacked models were trained to predict schizophrenia, using PRS for schizophrenia (PRSSZ), sex, parental depression, educational attainment, winter birth, handedness and number of siblings as predictors. Models were evaluated for discrimination using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and relative importance of predictors using permutation feature importance (PFI). In a secondary analysis, fitted models were tested for association with schizophrenia-related traits which had not been used in model development. Following learning curve analysis, 738 cases and 3690 randomly sampled controls were selected from the UK Biobank. ML models combining all predictors showed the highest discrimination (linear SVM, AUROC = 0.71), but did not significantly outperform logistic regression. AUROC was robust over 100 random resamples of controls. PFI identified PRSSZ as the most important predictor.

In this study, we aimed to examine the clinical and genetic associations of adult weight trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) in the BioMe Biobank. Methods: We constructed four weight trajectories based on a-priori definitions of weight changes (5% or 10%) using annual weight in EHRs (stable weight, weight gain, weight loss, and weight cycle); the final weight dataset included 21 487 participants with 162 783 annual weight measures. To confirm accurate assignment of weight trajectories, we manually reviewed weight trajectory plots for 100 random individuals. We then did a hypothesis-free phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify diseases associated with each weight trajectory. Next, we estimated the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability (hSNP2) of weight trajectories using GCTA-GREML, and we did a hypothesis-driven analysis of anorexia nervosa and depression polygenic risk scores (PRS) on these weight trajectories, given both diseases are associated with weight changes. We extended our analyses to the UK Biobank to replicate findings from a patient population to a generally healthy population. Findings: We found high concordance between manually assigned weight trajectories and those assigned by the algorithm (accuracy ≥98%). Stable weight was consistently associated with lower disease risks among those passing Bonferroni-corrected p value in our PheWAS (p≤4·4 × 10–5). Additionally, we identified an association between depression and weight cycle (odds ratio [OR] 1·42, 95% CI 1·31–1·55, p≤7·7 × 10–16). The adult weight trajectories were heritable (using 5% weight change as the cutoff: hSNP2 of 2·1%, 95% CI 0·9–3·3, for stable weight; 4·1%, 1·4–6·8, for weight gain; 5·5%, 2·8–8·2, for weight loss; and 4·7%, 2·3–7·1%, for weight cycle). Anorexia nervosa PRS was positively associated with weight loss trajectory among individuals without eating disorder diagnoses (OR1SD 1·16, 95% CI 1·07–1·26, per 1 SD higher PRS, p=0·011), and the association was not attenuated by obesity PRS. No association was found between depression PRS and weight trajectories after permutation tests. All main findings were replicated in the UK Biobank (p<0·05).

Genetic and environmental contributions to stability and change in social inhibition across the adolescent and adult life span,"Li-Gao, R.; Boomsma, D.I.; Dolan, C.V.; De Geus, E.J.C.; Denollet, J.; Kupper, N.","Feeling inhibited and socially not at ease is reflected in the trait social inhibition (SI). SI is associated with psychopathology that arises in young adulthood, such as anxiety. We aim for a better insight into the genetic and environmental contributions to SI across the life span, and as such examine their contributions to SI stability and change across adolescent and adult life span. We analyzed cohort-sequential longitudinal data from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), spanning a period of 25 years (Men (N, %): 17855, 37.4%; Age (Median, IQR): 19 years, 16-26 years; 7474 complete MZ twins and 8799 complete DZ twins).

SI was assessed with the ASEBA-based proxy questionnaire. Phenotypic stability was established across the entire age range. Next, a longitudinal genetic simplex model was fitted to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to the observed phenotypic stability. Results showed SI correlated well across follow-up of a single decade (.44 ≤ r ≤ .59) and moderately across the 25 years (.23 - .32) from adolescence to middle-age and older. Broad-sense heritability (h²) was between 40 and 48% across the 7 age groups. Additive and nonadditive genetic effects together explained most of the stability of SI across the life span (about 60-90% of the phenotypic correlation between ages), whereas environmental effects played a lesser role (about 10-40%). Concluding, SI, known to increase the risk of internalizing psychopathology, is phenotypically stable across the life span, which is largely attributable to genetic contributions to individual differences in SI.

Psychological Resilience in Adolescence as a function of Genetic Risk for Major Depressive Disorder and Alzheimer’s Disease,"Petrican, R.; Fornito, A.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are two pathologies linked to prior stress exposure and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories. As a putative antecedent to AD, MDD could be key to understanding the neurobiological changes that precede the clinical onset of AD by decades. To test this hypothesis, we used longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (Ntotal = 980, 470 females) and investigated overlapping connectomic, transcriptomic, and chemoarchitectural correlates of adjustment to stressors (i.e., resilience) among adolescents at genetic risk for AD and MDD, respectively. The potential for perinatal adversity to directly and/or indirectly, via accelerated biological ageing, foster resilience (i.e., “inoculation” effects) was also probed. We identified two distinguishable neurodevelopmental profiles predictive of resilience among MDD-vulnerable adolescents. One profile, expressed among the fastest developing youth, overlapped with areas of greater dopamine receptor density and reflected the maturational refinement of the inhibitory control architecture. The second profile distinguished resilient MDD-prone youth from psychologically vulnerable adolescents genetically predisposed towards AD. This profile, associated with elevated GABA, relative to glutamate, receptor density, captured the longitudinal refinement and increasing context specificity of incentive-related brain activations. Its transcriptomic signature implied that poorer resilience among AD-prone youth may be associated with greater expression of MDD-relevant genes. Our findings are compatible with the proposed role of MDD as a precursor to AD and underscore the pivotal contribution of incentive processing to this relationship. They further speak to the key neuromodulatory role of DA-gonadal hormone interactions in fostering resilience in adolescence.",2022,,medRxiv,,"(Petrican R., petricanr@cardiff.ac.uk) Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC), School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Maindy Road, Cardiff, United Kingdom(Fornito A., alex.fornito@monash.edu) The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental",,,10.1101/2022.07.19.22277815,,#2002,Petrican 2022,"",""
Is subthreshold depression in adolescence clinically relevant?,"Noyes, B.K.; Munoz, D.P.; Khalid-Khan, S.; Brietzke, E.; Booij, L.","Background: Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in adolescence, but compared to major depressive disorder, the clinical impact is under-researched. The aim of this review was to compare subthreshold depression and major depressive disorder in adolescents by reviewing available literature on epidemiology, risk factors, illness trajectories, brain anatomy and function, genetics, and treatment response. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of papers on subthreshold depression and major depressive disorder in adolescence published in English. Studies in adults were included when research in adolescence was not available. Results: We found that individuals with subthreshold depression were similar to individuals with major depressive disorder in several regards, including female/male ratio, onset, functional impairment, comorbidity, health care utilization, suicidal ideation, genetic predisposition, brain alterations, and treatment response. Further, subthreshold depression was about two times more common than major depressive disorder. Limitations: The definition of subthreshold depression is highly variable across studies. Adolescent-specific data are limited in the areas of neurobiology and treatment. Conclusions: The findings of the current review support the idea that subthreshold depression is of clinical importance and provide evidence for a spectrum, versus categorical model, for depressive symptomatology.

Gene–Environment Correlation over Time: A Longitudinal Analysis of Polygenic Risk Scores for Schizophrenia and Major Depression in Three British Cohorts Studies,"Machlitt-Northen, S.; Keers, R.; Munroe, P.B.; Howard, D.M.; Pluess, M.","Research suggests that both genetic and environmental risk factors are involved in the aetiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Importantly, environmental and genetic risk factors are often related as evidenced in gene–environment correlation (rGE), which describes the observation that genetic and environmental factors are associated with each other. It is understood that rGE gets stronger over time as individuals select their environments more actively based on their genetic propensities. However, little is known whether rGEs remain stable over time or change across different development periods. Using data from three British longitudinal cohorts, we investigated whether rGE patterns of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for SCZ and MDD changed over time across childhood and adulthood, as well as across both from birth to age 55 and whether results differed between SCZ and MDD. Overall, the majority of rGEs remained stable across the investigated development periods. Furthermore, the few detected rGE changes which did differ between SCZ and MDD, could not be explained by the confounding of clinical cases and are therefore likely the result of actual changes in environmental and cultural risk factors with genetic susceptibility to SCZ and MDD likely playing a less significant role.",2022,,Genes,13,7,,,10.3390/genes13071136,,#2004,Machlitt-Northen 2022,Abraham Guo (2025-09-03 10:25:04)(Screen): Longitudinal study that exceed our age range; ,For Mahnoor's review?; PRS x life stress interaction
Evaluation of Pediatric Patients with First Seizure,"Cirakli, S.; Usta, H.; Aygün, A.","Objective: Pediatric seizure is a condition that occurs due to many different underlying causes and causes fear and anxiety in families. In our study, it was aimed to evaluate pediatric seizure cases who applied to our hospital. Methods: Patients aged 0-18 years, who applied to the pediatric emergency department of our hospital between May 2018 and May 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were evaluated in terms of age, gender, seizure types, familial genetic predisposition, examination, treatment and follow-up. Seizures were divided into 2 groups as focal and generalized according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification. The treatment methods applied with cranial magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography recordings of the patients were evaluated. Results: Of the 118 patients included in the study, 70 (59 %) were girls and 48 (41 %) were boys. The mean age was 60 (3-192) months. Family history was present in 18 (15 %) cases. 8 (7 %) of the seizures are partial and 110 (93 %) of them are generalized. Since seizure recurrence was observed within 24 hours in 5 of 36 patients who were evaluated as febrile seizures, they were evaluated as complicated febrile seizures and drug treatment was started. The other 31 patients were evaluated as simple febrile seizures. There was no biochemical abnormality in the seizure etiology in any of the cases. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed polymicrogyria in 2 patients, hydrocephalus in 2 patients, brain tumor in 1 patient, and arteriovenous malformation in 1 patient. Conclusions: In cases presenting with seizures, the underlying causes should be identified and their treatment should be arranged. Cases with recurrent seizures should also be followed closely.",2022,,Konuralp Tip Dergisi,14,2,411-414,,10.18521/ktd.1118913,,#2006,Cirakli 2022,"",""
Risk of non-fatal suicide attempt in individuals with substance use disorder: The roles of aggregate genetic liability and environmental exposures in a Swedish population-based cohort,"Lannoy, S.; Ohlsson, H.; Stephenson, M.; Kendler, K.S.; Sundquist, J.; Sundquist, K.; Edwards, A.C.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Substance use disorder (SUD) is related to widespread adverse consequences including higher suicidality. Shared genetic liability has been demonstrated between SUD and suicidality. Here, we measured the factors that contribute to increased risk of non-fatal suicide attempt among individuals with SUD by focusing on aggregate genetic risks and both childhood and past-year environmental factors. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. Family genetic risk scores and environmental factors (childhood, from 0 to 15 years old; and the year preceding SUD registration) were used to predict the relative risk of non-fatal suicide attempt using Cox proportional hazards models. Additional analyses employed a co-relative design, accounting for genetic factors and shared familial environment, to test for potential causality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Based on longitudinal Swedish registry data, 228,617 individuals with SUD registrations from 1991 to 2015 were included. MEASUREMENTS: SUD and suicide attempt were identified using medical records (International Classification of Diseases codes). SUD was also identified using pharmacy and criminal registries. FINDINGS: In multivariable analyses that jointly accounted for all the selected potential predictors, individuals with SUD were at higher risk for non-fatal suicide attempt if they had experienced a parental death (hazard ratio [HR]=1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.30;1.93), were female (HR=1.53, 95%CI:1.49;1.57), had low educational attainment (HR=1.50, 95%CI:1.46;1.55), received social welfare (HR=1.21, 95%CI:1.17;1.25), or had lived in a non-intact family (HR=1.11, 95%CI:1.08;1.14). In co-relative analyses, low education was supported as a possible causal factor for suicide attempt. Aggregate genetic risks interacted with low education and being raised in a non-intact family, with increased prevalence of suicide attempt in people with high genetic risks and unfavorable environmental exposures.

Association of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms With Substance Misuse in 2 Longitudinal Cohorts in Sweden,"Virtanen, S.; Kuja-Halkola, R.; Sidorchuk, A.; Fernández De La Cruz, L.; Rück, C.; Lundström, S.; Suvisaari, J.; Larsson, H.; Lichtenstein, P.; Mataix-Cols, D.; Latvala, A.","Importance: Neurobiological models have postulated shared neural mechanisms between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorders, but results from clinical and epidemiological studies are conflicting or even suggest that OCD may be protective against substance misuse. Objective: To investigate whether OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with substance misuse and the extent to which shared genetic and/or environmental factors account for this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, individuals in the general population of Sweden born between January 1, 1932, and December 31, 1997 (population cohort), were followed up through Swedish nationwide registers from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2013. The second cohort included twin participants in the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) followed up from ages 18 to 24 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Exposures: Lifetime International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, diagnosis of OCD in the National Patient Register (population cohort 1), and self-reported obsessive-compulsive symptoms at 18 years of age (CATSS cohort). Main Outcomes and Measures: Substance misuse was defined as registered substance use-related disorder, criminal conviction, or death (population cohort), and self-reported alcohol and drug dependence symptoms at 18 and 24 years of age (CATSS cohort). Results: The general population cohort included 6304188 individuals (48.9% women and 51.1% men; median baseline age, 30.5 [IQR, 15.0-46.4] years), of whom 27342 had an OCD diagnosis. Obsessive-compulsive disorder was associated with an elevated risk of substance misuse (hazard ratio, 3.68 [95% CI, 3.52-3.85]). In the 9230 individuals in the CATSS cohort (5551 women [60.1%] and 3679 men [39.9%]), obsessive-compulsive symptoms at 18 years of age were associated with increased symptoms of alcohol dependence (concurrent [n = 9219], β = 0.18 [95% CI, 0.16-0.20]; longitudinal [n = 3381], β = 0.10 [95% CI, 0.06-0.14]) and drug dependence (concurrent [n = 749], β = 0.19 [95% CI, 0.11-0.27]; longitudinal [n = 452], β = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.04-0.25]). Comorbid anxiety and depression did not entirely explain the associations in either cohort. Using data from full siblings and maternal half-siblings (population cohort) and monozygotic and dizygotic twins (CATSS cohort) provided estimates of the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to the covariance between OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and substance misuse or dependence. The associations were explained by genetic (56%-68%) and nonshared environmental (32%-44%) factors. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this Swedish population-based cohort study challenge the notion that OCD is protective against developing substance misuse. The association of OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms with substance misuse was largely explained by shared genetics but was also compatible with partial environmental mediation..",2022,,JAMA Network Open,5,6,,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.14779,,#2008,Virtanen 2022,"",""

Here, we performed a meta-genome-wide association study within the EAGLE consortium and investigated polygenic overlap with later-life traits, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and cognition. Methods: We studied 37,913 parent-reported vocabulary size measures (English, Dutch, Danish) for 17,298 children of European descent. Meta-analyses were performed for early-phase expressive (infancy, 15-18 months), late-phase expressive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) and late-phase receptive (toddlerhood, 24-38 months) vocabulary. Subsequently, we estimated Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism heritability (SNP-h2), genetic correlations (rg) and modelled underlying genetic factor structures with multivariate models. Results: Contributions of common genetic variation to early-life vocabulary were modest (SNP-h2: 0.08(SE=0.01) to 0.24(SE=0.03)) and multi-factorial. Genetic overlap between infant expressive and toddler receptive vocabulary was near zero (rg=0.07(SE=0.10)), although both measures were genetically related to toddler expressive vocabulary (rg=0.69(SE=0.14) and rg=0.67(SE=0.16), respectively). Consistently, polygenic association patterns with later-life traits differed: Genetic links with cognition emerged only in toddlerhood (e.g. toddler receptive vocabulary and intelligence: rg=0.36(SE=0.12)), despite comparable study power for infant measures.

"A multivariate genetic analysis of environmental sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity and reported life events in adolescents","Peel, A.J.; Oginni, O.; Assary, E.; Krebs, G.; Lockhart, C.; McGregor, T.; Palaiologou, E.; Ronald, A.; Danese, A.; Eley, T.C.","Background. Despite being considered a measure of environmental risk, reported life events are partly heritable. One mechanism that may contribute to their heritability is genetic influences on sensitivity. These sensitivity biases can relate to how individuals process the contextual aspects of their environment (environmental sensitivity) or how they interpret their own physical and emotional responses (anxiety sensitivity). The aim of this study was to explore the genetic and environmental overlap between self-reported life events and measures of sensitivity. Methods. At age 17, individuals (N = 2,939) from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) completed measures of environmental sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Child Scale) and anxiety sensitivity (Children's Anxiety Sensitivity Index), as well as reporting on their experience of 20 recent life events. Using multivariate Cholesky decomposition models, we investigated the shared genetic and environmental influences on the associations between these measures of sensitivity and the number of reported life events, as well as both negative and positive ratings of life events. Results. The majority of the associations between anxiety sensitivity, environmental sensitivity and reported life events were explained by shared genetic influences (59%-75%), with the remainder explained by non-shared environmental influences (25%-41%). Environmental sensitivity showed comparable genetic correlations with both negative and positive ratings of life events (rA = .21 and .15), anxiety sensitivity only showed a significant genetic correlation with negative ratings of life events (rA = .33). Approximately 10% of the genetic influences on reported life events were accounted for by genetic influences shared with anxiety sensitivity and environmental sensitivity. Conclusions. A proportion of the heritable component of reported life events is captured by measures of sensitivity. Differences in how individuals process the contextual aspects of the environment or interpret their own physical and emotional response to environmental stimuli may be one mechanism through which genetic liability influences the subjective experience of life events.",2022,,medRxiv,,"(Peel A.J.; Oginni O.; Assary E.; Krebs G.; Lockhart C.; McGregor T.; Palaiologou E.; Danese A.; Eley T.C., thalia.eley@kcl.ac.uk) Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College Lo",,,10.1101/2022.05.24.22275523,,#2022,Peel 2022,"",""
Neurite outgrowth deficits caused by rare PLXNB1 mutation in pediatric bipolar disorder,"Yang, G.; Parker, E.; Gorsi, B.; Liebowitz, M.; Maguire, C.; King, J.B.; Coon, H.; Lopez-Larson, M.; Anderson, J.; Yandell, M.; Shcheglovitov, A.","Pediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD) is a severe mood dysregulation condition that affects 0.5–1% of children and teens in the United States. It is associated with recurrent episodes of psychosis and depression and an increased risk of suicidality. However, the genetics and neuropathology of PBD are largely unknown. Here, we used a combinatorial family-based approach to characterize the cellular, molecular, genetic, and network-level deficits associated with PBD. We recruited a PBD patient and three unaffected family members from a family with a history of psychiatric illnesses. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we detected altered resting-state functional connectivity in the patient as compared to the unaffected sibling. Using transcriptomic profiling of patient and control induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived telencephalic organoids, we found aberrant signaling in the molecular pathways related to neurite outgrowth. We corroborated the presence of neurite outgrowth deficits in patient iPSC-derived cortical neurons and identified a rare homozygous loss-of-function PLXNB1 variant (c.1360C>C; p.Ser454Arg) in the patient. Expression of wild-type PLXNB1, but not the variant, rescued neurite outgrowth deficit in patient neurons, and expression of the variant caused neurite outgrowth deficit in cortical neurons from PlxnB1 knock-out mice. These results indicate that dysregulated PLXNB1 signaling may contribute to an increased risk of PBD and other mood dysregulation-related disorders by disrupting neurite outgrowth and functional brain connectivity.

Genetics of Self-injurious Behaviour,"","Brief SummaryNonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is being increasingly regarded as a separate psychiatric disorder. Since the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-5 from 2013 defined NSSI as a separate diagnosis under section III - Conditions for Further Study, the knowledge about this field has increased considerably; however, the aetiology of this behaviour has still not been explained. There are many psychological explanations for the development and the continuation of NSSI. Researchers have identified the most common comorbidities (depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety). The causes of NSSI are not known, although studies that have been carried out so far indicate both genetic and environmental factors. The research included 95 adolescents with NSSI (participants were diagnosed based on the DSM-5 criteria), an original control group consisting of 21 people without NSSI, and 118 individuals from the general population as an additional control group for genetic research. For all participants we carried out the genotyping of polymorphisms for the TPH1 (rs4537731, rs1799913, rs7933505), SLC6A4 (VNTR STin2), OPRM1 (rs1799971), GNβ3 (rs5443) and DRD2/ANKK1 (rs1800497) genes. The participants with NSSI and the control group without NSSI completed translated questionnaires for the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI), MacLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD) and the Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF). The participants with NSSI also completed the questionnaire for the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury (ISAS), and the Self-Injury Craving Questionnaire (SICQ). The investigators carried out an association analysis and G x E analyses. The aim of the research was to carry out the first G x E study on the etiology of NSSI in Slovene adolescents. We have hypothesized that NSSI could be associated with one of the candidate polymorphisms or a combination of candidate polymorphisms. Further we have hypothesized that the genetic polymorphisms associated to NSSI are the most connected to NSSI in traumatised individuals and that NSSI is associated with higher impulsivity.Detailed DescriptionTheoretical background The etiology of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) has still not been explained. Studies that have been carried out so far indicate both genetic and environmental factors. It has been suggested, that NSSI is a polygenic disorder. Two neurotransmitter systems, the serotonergic system and the endogen opioids system, are the main candidate systems in the etiology of NSSI. The serotonin system is important in comorbid disorders of NSSI (depression, anxiety...). There is also growing importance of its direct involvement in NSSI. Deficiency of tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, has been connected with increasing frequency of NSSI. Variable-number tandem repeat polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene - SLC6A4 (VNTR STin2) has been associated with borderline personality disorder, a disorder with frequent NSSI, in one study. The are some important polymorphisms of the gene for the tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme, the main enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin. The polymorphism rs1799913 has been associated with depression and with parasuicidal behavior. This polymorphism is, together with some other polymorphisms (e.g. rs4537731, rs7933505), a part of a haplotype. This haplotype has already shown some connections with borderline personality disorder. There is also growing evidence that the changes in concentration of endogenous opioids (EO) could be associated with NSSI. Significantly lower β-endorphin and met-enkephalin values in the liquor of individuals with NSSI had been demonstrated. A recent study has shown significantly lower basal β-endorphin levels in adolescents with NSSI, when compared to healthy controls. Naomi I. Eisenberger is a leader in studying polymorphisms of endogenous opioids in conjunction with ""emotional"" pain. People with a lower threshold for physical pain also described a greater sensitivity to emotional pain. There is numerous evidence of the significant effect of the polymorphism of the gene for the mu-opioid receptor OPRM1 (A118G; rs1799971) on altered sensitivity to physical pain, pain perception and response to opiate analgesics. A significantly increased sensitivity of G allele carriers to social rejection (i.e. on a model for ""emotional"" pain) has been demonstrated. A number of studies have been conducted on the impact of the rs1799971 polymorphism on craving and addiction. Given the theoretical addictive background of NSSI and the interconnectedness of physical and emotional pain and the role of the rs1799971 polymorphism, this polymorphism is an important candidate polymorphism in NSSI. For individual addictions, different, partly conflicting results appear. Various studies have confirmed the G allele as a risk factor for various addictions, while others have not demonstrated any impact or have found a reduced risk of addiction in G allele carriers. Thus, in 2016, the first collaborative analysis was carried out in which 9064 subjects of the Caucasian population were included. In this large, European sample, the G allele proved to be a significant (OR = 0.90; confidence interval 95 % (0.83 - 0.97); p = 0.0095) protective factor for addiction in general. Direct studies of craving and the impact of rs1799971 on craving are rare and contradictory. There has been little research on potential genetic influences on the development of NSSI and rs1799971 does not appear to have been studied in this field. The main target of antipsychotics, the dopamine receptor D2, is also important in the research of addiction. The most famous polymorphism of the dopamine receptor 2 gene is the Taq1A (TaqIA) (rs1800497) polymorphism. Two alleles of rs1800497 are known - A1 and A2. Allele A1 has been associated with pathological gambling, a typical behavioral addiction, in one study. It has also been associated with impulsivity and addictive behavior in some other studies. The A1 allele has also been associated with borderline personality traits. G - proteins have been connected with the proper activity of numerous receptors. The polymorphism C825T (rs5443) of the G protein beta 3 gene (GNbeta3) has in some research been connected with depression. In one study, the T allele carriers had a statistical higher risk for NSSI as other depressive patients. Diminished pain perception and a higher pain threshold in people with NSSI have been shown. Ethics committee approval and project registration The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia (number 69/06/13). It has been chosen and registered as an internal scientific research and developmental project of the University Medical Centre Maribor, Slovenia, on 1.8.2013 (project number IRP-2013/01-07). Questionnaires All adolescents from the clinical sample and the original control group filled out the Slovenian version of the self-assessment questionnaire of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and the following questionnaires, translated into Slovene: Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), MacLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD), Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF). The STAI measures two forms of anxiety. ""State anxiety"" measures the current state, i.e. the level of anxiety that the individual feels at a given event. ""Trait anxiety"" refers to the long-term state of the individual. BIS-11 is probably the most frequently used instrument for the measurement of impulsivity. The MSI-BPD is a screening questionnaire used to search for borderline personality disorder in adolescence. ETISR-SF measures the childhood trauma, including physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as general traumatic events. In order to identify NSSI, the investigators used the Slovenian translation of the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury (ISAS) and the Slovenian translation of the Self-Injury Craving Questionnaire (SICQ) for the clinical sample. The ISAS is a questionnaire consisting of two parts. The first part consists of 12 questions about self-injurious behavior and the second part of questions about 13 functions of NSSI. The SICQ contains 7 questions about the craving for NSSI. DNA extraction and genotyping There is little research about genetics of NSSI. Some candidate genetic polymorphisms had been chosen with the help of this information. Predominantly, the candidate genetic polymorphisms in the study have therefor been chosen with the help of information about genetics of addiction and comorbid disorders (depression, borderline personality disorder, ...). DNA for genotyping was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using TRI-reagent (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Quality and concentration of extracted DNA was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and SynergyTM 2 (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) spectrophotometer. For the genotyping of the polymorphisms, the investigators first performed the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and then the high resolution melting (HRM) or the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. The qPCR was performed as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, multiplication, 45 cycles of 95°C 10 s, 60°C 15 s, 72°C 10 s. The HRM has been made at the following protocol: 95°C 1 min, 40°C 1 min, 60 - 90°C at 0,02 °C/s and cooling at 40°C for 10 s. The HRM reaction has been made with the LightCycler® 480 (Roche) and the LC480 HRM Master Mix (Roche) has been used. The investigators have analyzed the genotypes from the melting curves (TABLE 1). In the RFLP protocol, the product of the qPCR has been incubated with the right restriction enzyme from New England Biolabs (TABLE 1). Analysis has been done with agarose gel electrophoresis (2 % agarose gel, tris borate EDTA buffer). The DNA samples were mixed with 0.25% xylene cyanol and 40% sucrose. Electrophoresis has been run at 150 V for 20 minutes. At the end, the agarose gel has been analyzed under the UV light.

Statistical analysis The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics program package (IMB Inc., Armonk, New York). P ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The comparison of the share of traumatized and abused adolescents in the clinical sample and in the original control group has been done with the Fisher's exact test. All continuous variables were first assessed for the normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality. Correlation between the age at the onset of NSSI and the total number of NSSI in life was determined using Spearman's correlation. The relationship between the total number of self-injuries (NSSI) in life and the value on the SICQ questionnaire has also been assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Relationship of the value of the SICQ questionnaire and the time that passes from the thought of NSSI to NSSI and also genotype and the total number of NSSI in life both have been assessed using Kruskal-Wallis H-test. The Mann-Whitney U-test had been used to determine the relationship between genotype and the age at the onset of NSSI. Different logistic regression models with parameters of the ETISR-SF questionnaire / BIS-11 / MSI - BPD / STAI STETE / STAI TRAIT and the candidate genotypes as independent variables and NSSI as dependent variable have been made. Unadjusted analyses of the rs1799971 / rs1800497 genotype itself and craving variable were carried out using Mann-Whitney U-test. The contribution of the rs1799971 / rs1800497 genotype to the level of craving for NSSI (SICQ) was studied using generalized linear models and was adjusted to STAI STATE and STAI TRAIT / ETISR - SF. Logistic regression models with candidate genotypes as independent variables and pain perception during NSSI as dependent variable have been made. The contribution of the rs1799971 / rs1800497 genotype to pain perception has been studied using logistic regression models that were adjusted to STAI STATE / STAI TRAIT / MSI - BPD/ ETISR - SF. The relationship between pain perception during NSSI and craving (SICQ) was assessed using Mann-Whitney U-test. Aim of the study and the hypotheses The aim of the research was to carry out the first G x E study on the etiology of NSSI, diagnosed with the proposed research criteria from DSM-5, in Slovene adolescents. The investigators wanted to make the first association study of the rs1799971 in adolescents with NSSI and study the connection of the OPRM1 gene with addictive properties of NSSI and craving for NSSI. The goal was also to replicate the results of Joyce and his colleges (association of rs5443 and NSSI in depressive patients) in a sample of adolescents with NSSI. The investigators have hypothesized that NSSI could be associated with one of the candidate polymorphisms or a combination of candidate polymorphisms. Further the investigators have hypothesized that the genetic polymorphisms associated to NSSI are the most connected to NSSI in traumatised individuals and that NSSI is associated with higher impulsivity.",2022,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2026,,"",""
Two Models of the Development of Social Withdrawal and Social Anxiety in Childhood and Adolescence: Progress and Blind Spots,"Gazelle, H.","This commentary features a review of two recently reformulated models of the development of child and adolescent: (1) social withdrawal by Rubin and Chronis-Tuscano 2021, and (2) social anxiety by Spence and Rapee 2016. The articles that present these reformulated models now cover advances made during the prior 12 to 18 years of research, including increased knowledge of genetic vulnerability to anxiety and longitudinal patterns of development, and acknowledgement of multiple pathways towards and away from the development of social withdrawal or social anxiety (i.e., equifinality, multifinality). However, these reformulated models also contain several blind spots. The model of social withdrawal development would be improved by explicitly referring to peer treatment (not only attitudinal peer rejection), especially peer exclusion; and incorporating the potential development of clinically significant anxiety in childhood (not only adolescence) and delays in developmental milestones in adulthood. The model of social anxiety development would be improved by featuring social withdrawal as a proximal affective-behavioral profile (rather than a temperament) and drawing upon the literature on social withdrawal and its links to peer relations. Overall, there is a continuing lack of integration between developmental and clinical research and models of the development of social withdrawal and social anxiety.",2022,,Children,9,5,,,10.3390/children9050734,,#2028,Gazelle 2022,"",""
Longitudinal Changes in Structural Connectivity in Young People at High Genetic Risk for Bipolar Disorder,"Roberts, G.; Perry, A.; Ridgway, K.; Leung, V.; Campbell, M.; Lenroot, R.; Mitchell, P.B.; Breakspear, M.","Objective: Recent studies of patients with bipolar disorder or at high genetic risk reveal structural dysconnections among key brain networks supporting cognitive and affective processes. Understanding the longitudinal trajectories of these networks across the peak age range of bipolar disorder onset could inform mechanisms of illness onset or resilience. Methods: Longitudinal diffusion-weighted MRI and phenotypic data were acquired at baseline and after 2 years in 183 individuals ages 12-30 years in two cohorts: 97 unaffected individuals with a first-degree relative with bipolar disorder (the high-risk group) and 86 individuals with no family history ofmental illness (the control group). Whole-brain structural networks were derived using tractography, and longitudinal changes in these networks were studied using network-based statistics and mixed linear models. Results: Both groups showed widespread longitudinal changes, comprising both increases and decreases in structural connectivity, consistent with a shared neurodevelopmental process. On top of these shared changes, high-risk participants showed weakening of connectivity in a network encompassing the left inferior and middle frontal areas, left striatal and thalamic structures, the left fusiform, and right parietal and occipital regions. Connections among these regions strengthened in the control group, whereas they weakened in the high-risk group, shifting toward a cohort with established bipolar disorder. There was marginal evidence for even greater network weakening in those who had their first manic or hypomanic episode before follow-up. Conclusions: Neurodevelopment from adolescence into early adulthood is associated with a substantial reorganization of structural brain networks. Differences in these maturational processes occur in a multisystem network in individuals at high genetic risk of bipolar disorder. This may represent a novel candidate to understand resilience and predict conversion to bipolar disorder.",2022,,American Journal of Psychiatry,179,5,350-361,,10.1176/appi.ajp.21010047,,#2029,Roberts 2022,"",""
Specificity of cortical area and thickness as biomarkers for comorbid internalizing and externalizing mental disorders in pre-adolescence,"Kuang, N.; Liu, Z.; Yu, G.; Zhang, K.; Wu, X.; Becker, B.; Fan, H.; Zhao, J.; Kang, J.; Dong, G.; Zhao, X.; Feng, J.; Sahakian, B.J.; Robbins, T.W.; Schumann, G.; Palaniyappan, L.; Zhang, J.","Background: Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception for childhood and adolescent onset mental disorders, but we cannot predict its occurrence and do not know the neural mechanisms underlying comorbidity. We investigate if the effects of comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders on anatomical changes represent a simple aggregate of the effects on each disorder, and if comorbidity-related cortical surface changes relate to a distinct genetic underpinning. Methods: We studied the cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) of 11,878 preadolescents (9-10 years) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed models were implemented in comparative and association analyses among internalizing (Dysthymia, Major Depressive Disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, Specific Phobia, Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), externalizing diagnostic groups (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct disorder) a group with comorbidity of the two and a healthy control group. Genome-wide association analysis and cell type specificity analysis were performed on 4,716 unrelated European participants from this cohort. Results: Reduced cortical surface area but increased thickness occurs across patient groups when compared to controls. Children with comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders had more pronounced areal reduction than those without comorbidity, indicating an additive burden. In contrast, cortical thickness had a non-linear effect with comorbidity: the comorbid group had no significant CT changes, while those patient groups without comorbidity had significant thickness increases. Distinct biological pathways were implicated for regional SA and CT changes. Specifically, CT changes were associated with immune-related processes implicating microglia, while SA-related changes related mainly to excitatory neurons. Conclusions: The emergence of comorbidity across distinct clusters of psychopathology is unlikely to be a simple additive neurobiological effect. Distinct risk-adaptation processes, with unique genetic and cell-specific factors may underlie SA and CT changes. Children with highest risk but lowest resilience, both captured in their developmental morphometry, develop a comorbid illness pattern.",2022,,medRxiv,,"(Kuang N.; Yu G.; Wu X.; Fan H.; Zhao J.; Kang J.; Dong G.; Zhao X.; Feng J.; Sahakian B.J.; Robbins T.W.; Zhang J., zhangjie80@fudan.edu.cn) Institute of Science and Technology for Brain Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China(Kuang N.; ",,,10.1101/2022.04.24.22273790,,#2032,Kuang 2022,"",""
Detection of Parent-of-Origin Effects for the Variants Associated With Behavioral Disinhibition in the MCTFR Data,"Kong, Y.-F.; Li, M.-K.; Yuan, Y.-X.; Yang, Z.-Y.; Yu, W.-Y.; Zhao, P.-Z.; Zhou, J.-Y.","Behavioral disinhibition is one of the important characteristics of many mental diseases. It has been reported in literature that serious behavioral disinhibition will affect people’s health and greatly reduce people’s quality of life. Meanwhile, behavioral disinhibition can easily lead to illegal drug abuse and violent crimes, etc., which will bring great harm to the society. At present, large-scale genome-wide association analysis has identified many loci associated with behavioral disinhibition. However, these studies have not incorporated the parent-of-origin effects (POE) into analysis, which may ignore or underestimate the genetic effects of loci on behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, in this article, we analyzed the five phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition in the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research data (nicotine, alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, illicit drugs, and non-substance use related behavioral disinhibition), to further explore the POE of variants on behavioral disinhibition. We applied a linear mixed model to test for the POE at a genome-wide scale on five transformed phenotypes, and found nine SNPs with statistically significant POE at the significance level of 5 × 10−8. Among them, SNPs rs4141854, rs9394515, and rs4711553 have been reported to be associated with two neurological disorders (restless legs syndrome and Tourette’s syndrome) which are related to behavioral disinhibition; SNPs rs12960235 and rs715351 have been found to be associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, skin cancer and type I diabetes, while both SNPs have not been identified to be related to behavioral disinhibition in literature; SNPs rs704833, rs6837925, rs1863548, and rs11067062 are novel loci identified in this article, and their function annotations have not been reported in literature.

The male preponderance in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) prevalence is among the most pronounced sex ratios across different neurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between autism and typical sex-differential neuroanatomy, cognition, and related gene expression. Methods. Using a novel deep learning framework trained to predict biological sex, we compared sex prediction model performance across neurotypical and autistic males and females. Multiple large-scale datasets were employed at different stages of the analysis pipeline: a) Pre-training: the UK Biobank sample (>10.000 individuals); b) Transfer learning and validation: the ABIDE datasets (1,412 individuals, 5-56 years of age); c) Test and discovery: the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS LEAP dataset (681 individuals, 6-30 years of age) and d) Specificity: the Neuroimage and ADHD200 datasets (887 individuals, 7-26 years of age). Results: Across both ABIDE and LEAP we showed that features positively predictive of neurotypical males were on average more predictive of autistic males (P=1.1e-23). Features positively predictive of neurotypical females were on average less predictive of autistic females (P=1.2e-22). These accuracy differences in autism were not observed in individuals with ADHD. In autistic females the male-shifted neurophenotype was further associated with poorer social sensitivity and emotional face processing while also with associated gene expression patterns of midgestational cell types. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a shift in both autistic male and female individuals’ neuroanatomy towards male-characteristic patterns associated with typically sex-differential, social cognitive features and related gene expression patterns.

"Disparities in Knowledge, Attitude and Practices on Mental Health among Healthcare Workers and Community members in Meru County, Kenya","Kiilu, C.; Musembi, J.; Mukami, D.; Mwenda, C.; Opanga, Y.; Kimathi, G.","Background Mental health (MH) remains a neglected priority in many low and middle-income countries. Currently, there is inadequate data on the prevalence of mental health in Kenya. This is compounded by huge inequity in the distribution of skilled human resources for mental health services. Inadequate knowledge about mental health and negative attitudes towards people with mental health disorders is widespread among the general public. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey that utilised mixed methods for data collection. A total of 535 community members and 109 healthcare workers (HCWs) were targeted for the study. All cadres of healthcare workers in the selected health facilities who voluntarily consented to participate were recruited through simple random sampling. Data were collected using household surveys, Key Informant Interviews (KIIS) with facility in-charges; Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with community members particularly community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and youth; and In-depth Interviews (IDI) with community gate keepers such as religious leaders, Religious leader, Chiefs/sub-Chiefs, and traditional leaders. Data analysis included simple univariate frequencies of questions chosen to reflect the key concepts on mental health. Descriptive statistics were used to determine frequencies and percentages for the different variables under study. For qualitative data, thematic analysis was applied to generate themes through deductive and inductive methods. Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data was conducted. Results Approximately 39.1% of respondents reported to have had a family member with mental illness and 68% of HCWs reported to have diagnosed a patient with mental illness. 64% of respondents cited causes of mental disorders as witchcraft; generational curses in some families; genetic factors; drug and substance abuse especially marijuana; social and economic/financial pressures; and injuries from accidents. 93.3% of the HCWs reported to have referred patients to a mental health facility. Only 29.4% of the HCWs reported having counselling services in the facilities for patients with mental health needs. Majority (90.8% HCWs and 62.3% community members) reported that it is convenient for patients with MH needs and illness from the community to access the health care facilities and that MH services were available and mainly offered at the Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital (81.7% HCWs and 53.8% community members). Majority of HCWs (89.9%) reported that MH services were affordable to community members. On the contrary, only 44.4% of community members reported that MH services are affordable. The HCWs reported that the drugs were given for free at the health facilities while community members reported that sometimes stock-outs in drugs for MH existed in which case they would purchase drugs from pharmacies. Majority (96.4% HCWs and 62.5% community members) reported that patients with mental health needs and illness are treated with respect in the facilities. Aside from health facilities, community members also seek mental health services from: religious leaders; traditional healers including the Religious leader who were approached for cleansing if one believed that the mental health issues were a curse for committing certain offenses. It was also evident that some families did not seek any kind of help for their relatives with mental health illness and needs, with some even detaining them. Conclusion This study adds to the global knowledge on mental health among healthcare workers and community members providing vital data at service delivery level from an African developing country perspective. There is evidence of high burden of MH in the county with very few facilities offering MH services for patients. The existence of myths and misconceptions around the causes of MH is evident and needs to be addressed. There are also evident disparities in the perception of HCWs and Community members in MH with regards to availability and affordability of MH services and access to MH drugs. Communities still seek MH services from traditionalists and some people still neglect MH cases. Sustained poor mental health of individuals, families, the communities including healthcare workers has an enormous contribution towards negative health seeking behavior as well as social capital, an important determinant of health not just in Kenya but in many rural settings across the world. With this therefore, there is need to build the capacity of health care workers and create awareness to the community members as well as strengthen health systems to tackle MH.",2022,,medRxiv,,"(Kiilu C., colleta.kiilu@amref.org; Musembi J.; Mukami D.; Mwenda C.; Opanga Y.; Kimathi G.)

However, case-control status does not account for the fact that not all controls may have lived through their period of risk for the disorder of interest. This can be quantified by examining the age-of-onset distribution and the age of the controls or the age of onset for cases. The age-of-onset distribution may also depend on information such as sex and birth year. In addition, family history is not routinely included in the assessment of control status. Here, we present LT-FH++, an extension of the liability threshold model conditioned on family history (LT-FH), which jointly accounts for age of onset and sex as well as family history. Using simulations, we show that, when family history and the age-of-onset distribution are available, the proposed approach yields statistically significant power gains over LT-FH and large power gains over genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX). We applied our method to four psychiatric disorders available in the iPSYCH data and to mortality in the UK Biobank and found 20 genome-wide significant associations with LT-FH++, compared to ten for LT-FH and eight for a standard case-control GWAS.

Identification of alcohol-associated methylomic variation might provide novel insights into pathophysiology and novel treatment targets for AUD. Here we performed the largest single-cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption to date (N = 8161) and cross-validated findings in AUD populations with relevant endophenotypes, as well as alcohol-related animal models. Results showed 2504 CpGs significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Bonferroni p value < 6.8 × 10−8) with the five leading probes located in SLC7A11 (p = 7.75 × 10−108), JDP2 (p = 1.44 × 10−56), GAS5 (p = 2.71 × 10−47), TRA2B (p = 3.54 × 10−42), and SLC43A1 (p = 1.18 × 10−40). Genes annotated to associated CpG sites are implicated in liver and brain function, the cellular response to alcohol and alcohol-associated diseases, including hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. Two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship of consumption on AUD risk (inverse variance weighted (IVW) p = 5.37 × 10−09). A methylation-based predictor of alcohol consumption was able to discriminate AUD cases in two independent cohorts (p = 6.32 × 10−38 and p = 5.41 × 10−14). The top EWAS probe cg06690548, located in the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11, was replicated in an independent cohort of AUD and control participants (N = 615) and showed strong hypomethylation in AUD (p < 10−17). Decreased CpG methylation at this probe was consistently associated with clinical measures including increased heavy drinking days (p < 10−4), increased liver function enzymes (GGT (p = 1.03 × 10−21), ALT (p = 1.29 × 10−6), and AST (p = 1.97 × 10−8)) in individuals with AUD. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased SLC7A11 expression in the frontal cortex of individuals with AUD and animal models showed marked increased expression in liver, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol leads to hypomethylation-induced overexpression of SLC7A11. Taken together, our EWAS discovery sample and subsequent validation of the top probe in AUD suggest a strong role of abnormal glutamate signaling mediated by methylomic variation in SLC7A11. Our data are intriguing given the prominent role of glutamate signaling in brain and liver and might provide an important target for therapeutic intervention.",2022,,Molecular Psychiatry,27,3,1754-1764,,10.1038/s41380-021-01378-6,,#2040,Lohoff 2022,"",""

"Adolescent pain, anxiety, and depressive problems: A twin study of their co-occurrence and the relationship to substance use","Scaini, S.; Michelini, G.; De Francesco, S.; Fagnani, C.; Medda, E.; Stazi, M.A.; Battaglia, M.","Data on the etiological factors underlying the co-occurrence of common adolescent pain with anxiety and depression symptoms are very limited. Opioid prescriptions for adolescent pain problems are on the rise in North America and constitute a risk factor for diversion, misuse, and substance use. In this study, we aimed to investigate the phenotypic and etiological association among pain, depression, and anxiety and to test their link to substance use in adolescents. By taking advantage of the Italian National Twin Registry and of the relatively low incidence of opioid prescriptions in Italy, we applied multivariate modelling analyses to 748 Italian adolescent twins (374 pairs, mean age 16 ± 1.24 years). Twins' responses to the Achenbach Youth Self-Report questionnaire were used to build a composite adolescent pain index and to measure anxiety, depression, and substance use. All monozygotic within-pair correlations were higher than the dizygotic correlations, indicating genetic influences for adolescent pain, anxiety, and depressive problems. A common latent liability factor influenced by genetic and environmental elements shared among pain, depression, and anxiety provided the best fit to explain the co-occurrence of adolescent pain, anxiety, and depression problems. A common phenotypic factor capturing all 3 phenotypes was positively associated (β = 0.19, P < 0.001, confidence interval: 0.10-0.27) with substance use. These findings indicate that several intertwined mechanisms, including genetic factors, can explain a shared liability to common adolescent pain, anxiety, and depression problems.

Agency Deficits in a Human Genetic Model of Schizophrenia: Insights from 22q11DS Patients,"Salomon, R.; Kannape, O.A.; Debarba, H.G.; Kaliuzhna, M.; Schneider, M.; Faivre, N.; Eliez, S.; Blanke, O.","Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling mental illness characterized by a disordered sense of self. Current theories suggest that deficiencies in the sense of control over one's actions (Sense of Agency, SoA) may underlie some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, it is not clear if agency deficits are a precursor or a result of psychosis. Here, we investigated full body agency using virtual reality in a cohort of 22q11 deletion syndrome participants with a genetic propensity for schizophrenia. In two experiments employing virtual reality, full body motion tracking, and online feedback, we investigated SoA in two separate domains. Our results show that participants with 22q11DS had a considerable deficit in monitoring their actions, compared to age-matched controls in both the temporal and spatial domain. This was coupled with a bias toward erroneous attribution of actions to the self. These results indicate that nonpsychotic 22q11DS participants have a domain general deficit in the conscious sensorimotor mechanisms underlying the bodily self. Our data reveal an abnormality in the SoA in a cohort with a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia, but without psychosis, providing evidence that deficits in delineation of the self may be a precursor rather than a result of the psychotic state.",2022,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,48,2,495-504,,10.1093/schbul/sbab143,,#2046,Salomon 2022,"",""

"Association Between Childhood Maltreatment, FKBP5 Gene Methylation, and Anxiety Symptoms Among Chinese Adolescents: A Nested Case-Control Study","Lai, W.; Li, W.; Du, X.; Guo, Y.; Wang, W.; Guo, L.; Lu, C.","Background: Anxiety symptoms are common mental health problems among adolescents worldwide. This study aimed to explore (1) the longitudinal association between childhood maltreatment and anxiety symptoms, (2) the association between childhood maltreatment and DNA methylation of the FKBP5 gene, and (3) the association of DNA methylation of the FKBP5 gene with anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Methods: A nested case-control design was conducted to identify a case group and control group from a longitudinal study of adolescents aged 13–18 years in Guangzhou from 2019 to 2020. Adolescents with anxiety symptoms at baseline and follow-up were considered the case group, while those without anxiety symptoms at baseline and follow-up were considered the control group. The case and control groups were matched according to age and sex. Our study finally included 97 cases and 141 controls. Results: After adjusting for significant covariates, childhood emotional abuse was associated with subsequent anxiety symptoms (β = 0.146, 95% CI = 0.010~0.283); students with physical and emotional neglect were more likely to get a lower level of DNA methylation at most CpG units of FKBP5 gene (P < 0.05); FKBP5-12 CpG 15 methylation was associated with anxiety symptoms at follow-up (β = −0.263, 95% CI = −0.458~-0.069). However, after multiple hypothesis testing, childhood maltreatment was not associated with FKBP5 DNA methylation (q > 0.10); FKBP5 DNA methylation did not show an association with subsequent anxiety symptoms (q > 0.10). Conclusions: Childhood emotional abuse was associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents.

"Early intervention in bipolar affective disorders: Why, when and how","Pouchon, A.; Fakra, E.; Haesebaert, F.; Legrand, G.; Rigon, M.; Schmitt, E.; Conus, P.; Bougerol, T.; Polosan, M.; Dondé, C.","Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and severe psychiatric disease. There are often significant delays prior to diagnosis, and only 30 to 40 % of patients will experience complete remission. Since BD occurs most often at a young age, the disorder can seriously obstruct future socio-professional development and integration. Vulnerability-stress model of BD is considered to be the result of an interaction between vulnerability genes and environmental risk factors, which leads to the onset of the disorder most often in late adolescence or early adulthood. The clinical “staging” model of BD situates the subject in a clinical continuum of varying degrees of severity (at-risk status, first episode, full-blown BD). Given the demonstrated effectiveness of early intervention in the early stages of psychotic disorder, we posit that early intervention for early stages of BD (i.e. at-risk status and first episode mania or hypomania) would reduce the duration of untreated illness and optimize the chances of therapeutic response and recovery. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the literature to gather updated data on: (1) features of early stages: risk factors, at-risk symptoms, clinical specificities of the first manic episode; (2) early screening: targeted populations and psychometric tools; (3) early treatment: settings and therapeutic approaches for the early stages of BD. Results: (1) Features of early stages: among genetic risk factors, we highlighted the diagnosis of BD in relatives and affective temperament including as cyclothymic, depressive, anxious and dysphoric. Regarding prenatal environmental risk, we identified peripartum factors such as maternal stress, smoking and viral infections, prematurity and cesarean delivery. Later in the neurodevelopmental course, stressful events and child psychiatric disorders are recognized as increasing the risk of developing BD in adolescence. At-risk symptoms could be classified as “distal” with early but aspecific expressions including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, decreased cognitive performance, and more specific “proximal” symptoms which correspond to subsyndromic hypomanic symptoms that increase in intensity as the first episode of BD approaches. Specific clinical expressions have been described to assess the risk of BD in individuals with depression. Irritability, mixed and psychotic features are often observed in the first manic episode. (2) Early screening: some individuals with higher risk need special attention for screening, such as children of people with BD. Indeed, it is shown that children with at least one parent with BD have around 50 % risk of developing BD during adolescence or early adulthood. Groups of individuals presenting other risk factors, experiencing an early stage of psychosis or depressive disorders should also be considered as targeted populations for BD screening. Three questionnaires have been validated to screen for the presence of at-risk symptoms of BD: the Hypomanic Personality Scale, the Child Behavior Checklist-Paediatric Bipolar Disorder, and the General Behavior Inventory. In parallel, ultra-high risk criteria for bipolar affective disorder (“bipolar at-risk”) distinguishing three categories of at-risk states for BD have been developed. (3) Early treatment: clinical overlap between first psychotic and manic episode and the various trajectories of the at-risk status have led early intervention services (EIS) for psychosis to reach out for people with an early stage of BD. EIS offers complete biopsychosocial evaluations involving a psychiatric examination, semi-structured interviews, neuropsychological assessments and complementary biological and neuroimaging investigations. Key components of EIS are a youth-friendly approach, specialized and intensive care and client-centered case management model. Pharmaceutical treatments for at-risk individuals are essentially symptomatic, while guidelines recommend the use of a non-antipsychotic mood stabilizer as first-line monotherapy for the first manic or hypomanic episode. Non-pharmacological approaches including psychoeducation, psychotherapy and rehabilitation have proven efficacy and should be considered for both at-risk and first episode of BD. Conclusions: EIS for psychosis might consider developing and implementing screening and treatment approaches for individuals experiencing an early stage of BD. Several opportunities for progress on early intervention in the early stages of BD can be drawn. Training first-line practitioners to identify at-risk subjects would be relevant to optimize screening of this population. Biomarkers including functional and structural imaging measures of specific cortical regions and inflammation proteins including IL-6 rates constitute promising leads for predicting the risk of transition to full-blown BD. From a therapeutic perspective, the use of neuroprotective agents such as folic acid has shown particularly encouraging results in delaying the emergence of BD. Large-scale studies and long-term follow-up are still needed to achieve consensus in the use of screening and treatment tools. The development of specific recommendations for the early stages of BD is warranted.",2022,,Encephale,48,1,60-69,,10.1016/j.encep.2021.05.007,,#2053,Pouchon 2022,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Among the twins with CTD or GTS, 50% had at least one comorbidity, which is higher than in background populations. The GTS + OCD-phenotype was significantly more frequent among GTS-concordant than among discordant twins. No statistically significant differences were found between the GTS-concordant and discordant twin pairs regarding tic severity or comorbidities.

"The evolution of BDNF is defined by strict purifying selection and prodomain spatial coevolution, but what does it mean for human brain disease?","Lucaci, A.G.; Notaras, M.J.; Kosakovsky Pond, S.L.; Colak, D.","The mammalian gene Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is an essential mediator of brain assembly, development, and maturation which has been implicated in a variety of brain disorders such as neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder), neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD, schizophrenia), and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Parkinson's). Loss of BDNF during early development is embryonic lethal, and depletion of BDNF during adolescence or adulthood can result in disease-related neuropathology across a broad range of model organisms. In order to better understand the role of BDNF in disease, we seek to provide an evolutionary context to BDNF's role within the brain by elucidating the molecular and genetic comparative history of BDNF across species. We conduct sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction of the BDNF gene across a diverse selection of over 160 mammalian species spanning ~177 million years of evolution. Selective evolutionary change was examined via several independent computational models of codon evolution including FEL, MEME, and BGM. We report strict purifying selection in the main functional domain of BDNF (NGF domain, essentially comprising the mature BDNF protein). Specifically, we discover 6 sites in our homologous alignment which are under episodic selection in the early regulatory region of BDNF (i.e. the prodomain) and 23 pairs of coevolving sites that are a part of complex spatial relationships that are distributed across the entire BDNF gene. Thus, we propose that our discovery of both local and distal sites of co-evolution within the pro- and mature-domains of BDNF that likely reflect the evolutionary fine-tuning of BDNF's unique and complex regulatory capacities whilst also retaining it's core yet diverse ontogenic functionality within the central nervous system. This discovery consequently supports the idea that the BDNF prodomain is more prone to change than the mature domain, however the fact that this region has also been subject to negative purifying selection also highlights genetic sensitivity and thus partially explains the prodomain's disease relevance (e.g. Val66Met and other variants) to numerous neuropsychiatric disorders.",2022,,bioRxiv,,"(Lucaci A.G., alexander.lucaci@temple.edu; Kosakovsky Pond S.L.)

Prenatal stress and offspring depression in adulthood: The mediating role of childhood trauma,"Liu, Y.; Heron, J.; Hickman, M.; Zammit, S.; Wolke, D.","Background: There is repeated evidence for a prenatal programming effect for the development of offspring depression. However, examination of environmental influences along this pathway is sparse. This study aimed to investigate the direct and indirect effects of pre- and postnatal stress on offspring depression in adulthood, via increased exposure to childhood trauma. Methods: A large longitudinal population-based cohort (N = 3506) was followed up from birth and assessed at 24 years. Diagnosis of depression was derived using the International Classification of Diseases–10th revision (ICD-10). Two separate sources of pre- and postnatal stress were examined – maternal depression and family adversity, and childhood trauma was assessed prospectively across childhood until 17 years. Results: Both pre- and postnatal maternal depression and family adversity were associated with offspring depression at 24 years in simple logistic regression models. When all pathways were modelled simultaneously, only childhood trauma was directly associated with offspring depression, and mediated all pathways from both sources of pre- and postnatal stress to offspring depression (7–16% of the total effect mediated). Sensitivity analysis on specific trauma found stronger evidence for a mediated pathway via physical, emotional abuse and peer bullying, compared to emotional neglect, sexual abuse and domestic violence.

Pathogenetics of Internet addiction in adolescents,"Smolnikova, M.V.; Tereshchenko, S.Y.","The aim of the research. Internet addiction (IA) is a relatively new psychological phenomenon having signs of a social epidemic, specifically attributed to vulnerable groups (adolescents). The prevalence of IA among adolescents varies depending on the studied ethnosocial groups and the diagnostic criteria. In Europe, the prevalence of IA among adolescents is on average 4.4 % [1]. In Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, etc.), the prevalence of IA is significantly higher – 8.1-26.5 % [2]. The genetic component of developing Internet addiction was shown by twin studies using various populations, however, to date, the specific genes involved in the mechanisms of such heritability are not exactly identified [3]. The purpose of with work was to study the prevalence of Internet addiction options, different in severity, addiction pattern and content, in adolescents from ethnically different cities, to assess the frequency of mental and somatic comorbidity in selected groups, to investigate the associative role of candidate neurotransmitters and to conduct a population analysis of polymorphisms of candidate genes oxytocin-, dopamine-, serotonin-, norepinephrine-, melatonin-and nicotinergic neurotransmitter systems. Material and methods. The study of genetic predisposition to IA included adolescents living in Krasnoyarsk (n = 359), adolescents from Abakan (n = 150) and from Kyzyl (n = 200). In total 16 SNPs were genotyped by RT-PCR. Results. For the first time, data were obtained on the prevalence of IA among urban adolescents in Central Siberia – pathological Internet addicted behavior was registered in 6.8 % of an unbiased school sample in Krasnoyarsk (using a CIAS scale). The Internet addiction structure was as follows: Adaptive Internet Usage (expected frequency 60-75 %), revealed frequency – 46.9 %; Non-adaptive Internet Usage (expected frequency 20-30%), revealed frequency – 31.3 % and Internet Addiction (expected frequency 5-10 %), revealed frequency – 21.8. It is noteworthy that the frequency of non-adaptive adolescents among Tuvans is 45 %. Conclusion. Genotypes including the T allele rs1044396 CHRNA4 can be considered protective against IA among the Caucasians, while the CC genotype is predisposing to IA.

The aim of this study was to analyze the single and combined effects of IGF-1 polymorphisms (rs972936 and rs978458) and negative life events with MDD among Chinese population. Methods. 420 MDD patients (according to DSM-V) and 420 age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited in a case-control study.

Reward Processing in Children With Psychotic-Like Experiences,"Harju-Seppänen, J.; Irizar, H.; Bramon, E.; Blakemore, S.-J.; Mason, L.; Bell, V.","Alterations to striatal reward pathways have been identified in individuals with psychosis. They are hypothesized to be a key mechanism that generate psychotic symptoms through the production of aberrant attribution of motivational salience and are proposed to result from accumulated childhood adversity and genetic risk, making the striatal system hyper-responsive to stress. However, few studies have examined whether children with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) also exhibit these alterations, limiting our understanding of how differences in reward processing relate to hallucinations and delusional ideation in childhood. Consequently, we examined whether PLEs and PLE-related distress were associated with reward-related activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The sample consisted of children (N = 6718) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-10 years who had participated in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task in functional MRI. We used robust mixed-effects linear regression models to investigate the relationship between PLEs and NAcc activation during the reward anticipation and reward outcome stages of the MID task. Analyses were adjusted for gender, household income, ethnicity, depressive symptoms, movement in the scanner, pubertal development, scanner ID, subject and family ID. There was no reliable association between PLEs and alterations to anticipation- or outcome-related striatal reward processing. We discuss the implications for developmental models of psychosis and suggest a developmental delay model of how PLEs may arise at this stage of development.",2022,,Schizophrenia Bulletin Open,3,1,,,10.1093/schizbullopen/sgab054,,#2069,Harju-Seppänen 2022,"",""
The Clinical and Genetic Characteristics in Children with Idiopathic Hypogonadotropin Hypogonadism,"Zhou, Q.; Sheng, W.; Yang, S.; Zou, C.","Background. Idiopathic hypogonadotropin hypogonadism (IHH) is caused by hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction. This is divided into Kallmann syndrome which has an impaired sense of smell and hypogonadotropin hypogonadism with normal olfactory (nIHH sense. Approximately 60% of patients are associated with Kallmann syndrome, whereas there are approximately 40% with hypogonadotropin hypogonadism (nIHH). This disease is associated with various variants in genes along with different phenotypic characteristics, and even those gene variations could also lead to the cancer formation in patients. So, current study has been designed to investigate and to better understand the characteristics of various IHH-associated genes and the correlation between IHH genes and phenotype. Methods. The cohort included 14 children with IHH (6 patients of KS and 8 patients of IHH), including 13 boys and 1 girl. Exclusion criteria are as follows: diagnosis of secondary hypogonadotropin hypogonadism due to tumor, trauma, drugs, or other systemic diseases. Clinical data and genetic results were analyzed. Results. Almost all male patients showed micropenis (12/13, 92.3%), and few of them had cryptorchidism (5/13, 41.7%). A total of 6 genes, CHD7, PROKR2, ANOS1, FGFR1, SEMA3A, and NDNF, were detected. CHD7 was the most common (11/17, 64.7%), and the main mutation type was missense mutation (14/16, 87.5%). Six reported variants and 10 new variants (5 genes, including entire ANSO1 duplicates) were found. Neonatal variation was detected in 3 patients with IHH. Eight patients inherited the variation from their father, while five patients inherited it from their mother. One patient had both FGFR1 and SEMA3A gene variants, while the other had two different CHD7 gene variants and entire ANSO1 repeats. According to ACMG criteria, 4 variants were pathogenic (P), 2 were possibly pathogenic (LP), and 8 had uncertain significance (US). In patients with P or LP (5/6, 83.3%), we found that extragonadal symptoms were more common. Conclusions. It was concluded that variations in the studied genes could lead to the IHH. Ten new variants have been reported which may lead to different symptoms of IHH. For CHD7 variants, the rare sequencing variants (RSVs) of P or LP showed commonly associated with CHARGE syndrome.

Microglia and Sensitive Periods in Brain Development,"Dziabis, J.E.; Bilbo, S.D.","From embryonic neuronal migration to adolescent circuit refinement, the immune system plays an essential role throughout central nervous system (CNS) development. Immune signaling molecules serve as a common language between the immune system and CNS, allowing them to work together to modulate brain function both in health and disease. As the resident CNS macrophage, microglia comprise the majority of immune cells in the brain. Much like their peripheral counterparts, microglia survey their environment for pathology, clean up debris, and propagate inflammatory responses when necessary. Beyond this, recent studies have highlighted that microglia perform a number of complex tasks during neural development, from directing neuronal and axonal positioning to pruning synapses, receptors, and even whole cells. In this chapter, we discuss this literature within the framework that immune activation during discrete windows of neural development can profoundly impact brain function long-term, and thus the risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this chapter, we review three sensitive developmental periods – embryonic wiring, early postnatal synaptic pruning, and adolescent circuit refinement – in order to highlight the diversity of functions that microglia perform in building a brain. In reviewing this literature, it becomes obvious that timing matters, perhaps more so than the nature of the immune activation itself; largely conserved patterns of microglial response to diverse insults result in different functional impacts depending on the stage of brain maturation at the time of the challenge.",2022,,Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences,53,"(Dziabis J.E.; Bilbo S.D., staci.bilbo@duke.edu) Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States(Dziabis J.E.; Bilbo S.D., staci.bilbo@duke.edu) Department of Neurobiology, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States",55-78,,10.1007/7854_2021_242,,#2077,Dziabis 2022,"",""

Resolving heterogeneity in schizophrenia through a novel systems approach to brain structure: individualized structural covariance network analysis,"Liu, Z.; Palaniyappan, L.; Wu, X.; Zhang, K.; Du, J.; Zhao, Q.; Xie, C.; Tang, Y.; Su, W.; Wei, Y.; Xue, K.; Han, S.; Tsai, S.-J.; Lin, C.-P.; Cheng, J.; Li, C.; Wang, J.; Sahakian, B.J.; Robbins, T.W.; Zhang, J.; Feng, J.","Reliable mapping of system-level individual differences is a critical first step toward precision medicine for complex disorders such as schizophrenia. Disrupted structural covariance indicates a system-level brain maturational disruption in schizophrenia. However, most studies examine structural covariance at the group level. This prevents subject-level inferences. Here, we introduce a Network Template Perturbation approach to construct individual differential structural covariance network (IDSCN) using regional gray-matter volume. IDSCN quantifies how structural covariance between two nodes in a patient deviates from the normative covariance in healthy subjects. We analyzed T1 images from 1287 subjects, including 107 first-episode (drug-naive) patients and 71 controls in the discovery datasets and established robustness in 213 first-episode (drug-naive), 294 chronic, 99 clinical high-risk patients, and 494 controls from the replication datasets. Patients with schizophrenia were highly variable in their altered structural covariance edges; the number of altered edges was related to severity of hallucinations. Despite this variability, a subset of covariance edges, including the left hippocampus–bilateral putamen/globus pallidus edges, clustered patients into two distinct subgroups with opposing changes in covariance compared to controls, and significant differences in their anxiety and depression scores. These subgroup differences were stable across all seven datasets with meaningful genetic associations and functional annotation for the affected edges. We conclude that the underlying physiology of affective symptoms in schizophrenia involves the hippocampus and putamen/pallidum, predates disease onset, and is sufficiently consistent to resolve morphological heterogeneity throughout the illness course. The two schizophrenia subgroups identified thus have implications for the nosology and clinical treatment.",2021,,Molecular Psychiatry,26,12,7719-7731,,10.1038/s41380-021-01229-4,,#2082,Liu 2021,"",""

However, “twice-exceptional” individuals, those who demonstrate exceptionally high cognitive ability (gifted) and exhibit profound behavioral and mental health challenges, are a striking exception to this rule. Methods: We digitized the clinical records of N=1,074 clients from a US-based specialty clinic serving gifted students. This included a broad array of diagnostic, cognitive, achievement, and behavioral data, including self, teacher, and parent reported items. We conducted both hypothesis-driven and unsupervised learning analyses to 1) identify characteristics whose association with full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was dependent on autism diagnosis and 2) identify cognitive archetypes associated with autism diagnosis and related behaviors. We tested the generalization of our findings using data from the SPARK (N=17,634) and ABCD studies (N=10,602). Results: Autistic individuals with IQ >= 120 were nearly 15 times more likely to enter adulthood undiagnosed compared to lower-IQ (IQ < 70) counterparts. Self-reported sense of inadequacy was most strongly associated with increasing FSIQ specifically among autistic clients (beta=0.3, 95% CI:[0.15,0.45], p=7.1x10-5). Similarly, self, parent, and teacher reports of anxiety increased with FSIQ (all p<0.05) in autistic individuals, in striking opposition to the ameliorating effect of FSIQ seen in non-autistic individuals. We uncovered a pattern of decreased processing speed (PS) coupled with very high verbal comprehension (VC), a PS/VC discrepancy, that was associated with autism, inattention, and internalizing problems. Similar cognitive-behavioral links were also observed in the ABCD study. Finally, we found a significant association between the PS/VC discrepancy and polygenic risk for autism in the ABCD sample (t=2.9, p=0.004).

Emotional Dysregulation in Children and Adolescents With Psychiatric Disorders. A Narrative Review,"Paulus, F.W.; Ohmann, S.; Möhler, E.; Plener, P.; Popow, C.","Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a transdiagnostic construct defined as the inability to regulate the intensity and quality of emotions (such as, fear, anger, sadness), in order to generate an appropriate emotional response, to handle excitability, mood instability, and emotional overreactivity, and to come down to an emotional baseline. Because ED has not been defined as a clinical entity, and because ED plays a major role in child and adolescent psychopathology, we decided to summarize current knowledge on this topic based on a narrative review of the current literature. Methods: This narrative review is based on a literature search of peer-reviewed journals. We searched the databases ERIC, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX on June 2, 2020 for peer reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2020 in English language for the preschool, school, and adolescent age (2–17 years) using the following search terms: “emotional dysregulation” OR “affect dysregulation,” retrieving 943 articles. Results: The results of the literature search are presented in the following sections: the relationship between ED and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, Mood Disorders, Psychological Trauma, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Non-suicidal Self-Injury, Eating Disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder, Disruptive Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Personality Disorders, Substance Use Disorder, Developmental Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Psychosis and Schizophrenia, and Gaming Disorder), prevention, and treatment of ED.

Microglial functional alteration and increased diversity in the challenged brain: Insights into novel targets for intervention,"Tremblay, M.-È.","Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, which perform beneficial physiological roles across life. These immune cells actively maintain CNS health by clearing toxic debris and removing dysfunctional or degenerating cells. They also modify the wiring of neuronal circuits, by acting on the formation, modification, and elimination of synapses—the connections between neurons. Microglia furthermore recently emerged as highly diverse cells comprising several structural and functional states, indicating a far more critical involvement in orchestrating brain development, plasticity, behaviour, and cognition. Various environmental factors, together with the individual genetic predispositions, confer an increased risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases that include autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, across life. Microglia are highly sensitive to chronic psychological stress, inadequate diet, viral/bacterial infection, pollution, and insufficient or altered sleep, especially during critical developmental periods, but also throughout life. These environmental challenges can compromise microglial physiological functions, resulting notably in defective neuronal circuit wiring, altered brain functional connectivity, and the onset of behavioral deficits into adolescence, adulthood, and aging.

Major depressive disorder and lifestyle: Correlated genetic effects in extended twin pedigrees,"Huider, F.; Milaneschi, Y.; van der Zee, M.D.; de Geus, E.J.C.; Helmer, Q.; Penninx, B.W.J.H.; Boomsma, D.I.","In recent years, evidence has accumulated with regard to the ubiquity of pleiotropy across the genome, and shared genetic etiology is thought to play a large role in the widespread comorbidity among psychiatric disorders and risk factors. Recent methods investigate pleiotropy by estimating genetic correlation from genome-wide association summary statistics. More comprehensive estimates can be derived from the known relatedness between genetic relatives. Analysis of extended twin pedigree data allows for the estimation of genetic correlation for additive and non-additive genetic effects, as well as a shared household effect. Here we conduct a series of bivariate genetic analyses in extended twin pedigree data on lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) and three indicators of lifestyle, namely smoking behavior, physical inactivity, and obesity, decomposing phenotypic variance and covariance into genetic and environmental components. We analyze lifetime MDD and lifestyle data in a large multigenerational dataset of 19,496 individuals by variance component analysis in the ‘Mendel’ software. We find genetic correlations for MDD and smoking behavior (rG = 0.249), physical inactivity (rG = 0.161), body-mass index (rG = 0.081), and obesity (rG = 0.155), which were primarily driven by additive genetic effects.

Alterations in resting-state activity and functional connectivity in children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"Doherty, J.L.; Cunningham, A.C.; Chawner, S.J.R.A.; Moss, H.M.; Dima, D.C.; Linden, D.E.J.; Owen, M.J.; van den Bree, M.B.M.; Singh, K.D.","Background While genetic risk factors for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified, the neurobiological route from genetic risk to neuropsychiatric outcome remains unclear. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a copy number variant (CNV) syndrome associated with high rates of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. Alterations in neural integration and cortical connectivity have been linked to the spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders seen in 22q11.2DS and may be a mechanism by which the CNV acts to increase risk. Despite this, few studies have investigated electrophysiological activity and connectivity in this high-risk group. Methods Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to investigate resting-state cortical oscillatory patterns in 34 children with 22q11.2DS and 25 controls aged 10-17 years old. Oscillatory activity and functional connectivity across six frequency bands were compared between groups. Regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between these measures, IQ and neurodevelopmental symptoms. Results Children with 22q11.2DS had atypical oscillatory activity and functional connectivity across multiple frequency bands. In the 22q11.2DS group, low frequency (alpha band) activity was positively associated with cognitive ability, while connectivity was negatively associated with ASD and ADHD symptoms. Frontal high frequency (gamma band) activity and connectivity were positively associated with ASD and ADHD symptoms respectively, while posterior gamma activity was negatively associated with ASD symptoms.

They have a complex etiology in which genetic and environmental factors interact. Analyzing gene-environment interactions could help us to identify the mechanisms involved in the etiology of such conditions. For example, comethylation module analysis could detect the small effects of epigenetic interactions, reflecting the influence of environmental factors. We used MethylationEPIC and Psy-charray microarrays to determine DNA methylation levels and genotype from 63 teenagers with eating disorders. We identified 11 comethylation modules in WGCNA (Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis) and correlated them with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and clinical features in our subjects. Two comethylation modules correlated with clinical features (BMI and height) in our sample and with SNPs associated with these phenotypes. One of these comethylation modules (yellow) correlated with BMI and rs10494217 polymorphism (associated with waist-hip ratio). Another module (black) was correlated with height, rs9349206, rs11761528, and rs17726787 SNPs; these polymorphisms were associated with height in previous GWAS.

Cannabinoids: Emerging developments in neuropsychopharmacology and biological psychiatry,"Oleson, E.B.; Khokhar, J.Y.","Cannabinoids from the cannabis plant were one of the earliest psychoactive phytochemicals harnessed by humanity for their medicinal properties and remain one of the most frequently used and misused classes of chemicals in the world. Despite our long-standing history with cannabinoids, much more is said than is known regarding how these molecules influence the brain and behavior. We are in a rapidly evolving discovery phase regarding the neuroscience of cannabinoids. This period of insight began in the mid-1990s when it was discovered that phytocannabinoids (e.g., delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) act on G protein-coupled receptors (i.e., CB1/CB2) in the brain to produce their psychoactive effects. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that endogenous ligands (i.e., endocannabinoids) exist for these receptor targets and, that they are synthetized on demand under a variety of physiological conditions. Thus, we can now study how phytochemicals, endogenous ligands, and synthetic/metabolic enzymes of the endocannabinoid system influence the brain and behavior by activating known receptor targets. Our increased ability to study cannabinoid interactions with the brain and behavior coincides with an increase in international interest in utilizing cannabinoids as a medicine. At the same time, the potency of, and administration routes by which cannabinoids are used is rapidly changing. And, these trends in cannabinoid misuse are producing lasting neural adaptations that have implications for mental health. In this special edition, we will summarize our recent period of discovery regarding how: 1) phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids act on the brain to produce behavioral effects; 2) cannabinoids can be harnessed to produce pharmacotherapeutic utility in the field of medicine; and 3) use of increasingly more cannabinoid variants through unique routes of administration alter the brain and behavior, especially when used in critical developmental periods like pregnancy and adolescence.",2021,,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,110,"(Oleson E.B., erik.oleson@ucdenver.edu) Psychology Department, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, United States(Khokhar J.Y.)

Serotonin system genes contribute to the susceptibility to obesity in Black adolescents,"Meng, Y.; Groth, S.W.; Hodgkinson, C.A.; Mariani, T.J.","Objective: The importance of the central and peripheral serotonin systems in regulating energy balance and obesity development has been highlighted in animal models. Yet, the role of both serotonin systems has not been systematically assessed in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of genes within both serotonin systems with obesity outcomes in black adolescents. Methods: African–American adolescents (n = 1052) whose mothers participated the Memphis New Mother's Study were assessed. In total, 110 polymorphisms mapped to 10 serotonin genes were examined for their associations with standardized body mass index (BMI-z) scores and waist circumferences using generalized estimating equation models. Results: Over 39% of adolescents were overweight or had obesity. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TPH2, HTR3B, and SLC6A4, were significantly associated with BMI-z scores (p < 1.7 × 10−3). Two SNPs in TPH2 were nominally associated with waist circumferences. One SNP in HTR2C was associated with BMI-z scores (p = 0.001) and waist circumferences (p = 0.005) only in girls. Tissue-specific expression indicates that three identified genes are predominantly expressed in the brain.

We aim to quantitatively measure cerebral tissue R2* to investigate the brain iron deposition in children and young adults with SCD in comparison to beta thalassemia major (BTM) and healthy controls and evaluate its impact on neurocognitive functions in patients with SCD. Thirty-two SCD, fifteen BTM, and eleven controls were recruited. Multi-echo fast-gradient echo sequence brain MRI was performed, and brain R2* values of both caudate and thalamic regions were calculated. SCD patients were examined for the neurocognitive functions. SCD had high iron overload 0.30 ± 0.12 mg/kg/day. 68.9% of SCD had under-threshold IQ, 12.5% had moderate to severe anxiety, and 60.8% had depression. There were no differences between SCD, BTM, and controls in brain MRI except that left thalamus R2* higher in BTM than both SCD and controls (p = 0.032).

The extensively studied genotype–phenotype correlation is a crucial issue for a reliable counseling, as the disease is recognized at increasingly earlier stages of life, including prenatal period. Based on population studies, clusters in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes associated with the presence of glycine substitutions leading to fatal outcome have been distinguished and named as “lethal regions.” Their localization corresponds to the ligand-binding sites responsible for extracellular interactions of collagen molecules, which could explain high mortality associated with mutations mapping to these regions. Although a number of non-lethal cases have been identified from the variants located in lethal clusters, the mortality rate of mutations has not been updated. An next generation sequencing analysis, using a custom gene panel of known and candidate OI genes, was performed on a group of 166 OI patients and revealed seven individuals with a causative mutations located in the lethal regions. Patients’ age, ranging between 3 and 25 years, excluded the expected fatal outcome. The identification of non-lethal cases caused by mutations located in lethal domains prompted us to determine the actual mortality caused by glycine substitutions mapping to lethal clusters and evaluate the distribution of all lethal glycine mutations across collagen type I genes, based on records deposited in the OI Variant Database. Finally, we identified six glycine substitutions located in lethal regions of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, of which four are novel. The review of all mutations in the dedicated OI database, revealed 33 distinct glycine substitutions in two lethal domains of COL1A1, 26 of which have been associated with a fatal outcome. Similarly, 109 glycine substitutions have been identified in eight lethal clusters of COL1A2, of which 51 have been associated with a fatal manifestation.

We performed large-scale gene expression and genotype analyses in postmortem samples of two frontal cortical brain regions from 214 control subjects aged 20–90 years. Individual estimates of “molecular age” were derived from age-dependent genes, identified by robust regression analysis. Deviation from chronological age was defined as “delta age”.

ADHD-affected patients display visual–motor and visuospatial abilities and skills that depart from those exhibited by non-affected individuals and struggle with perceptual organization, which might partially explain impulsive responses. Endophenotypes (quantifiable or dimensional constructs that are closely related to the root cause of the disease) might provide a more powerful and objective framework for dissecting the underlying neurobiology of ADHD than that of categories offered by the syndromic classification. In here, we explore the potential presence of the linkage and association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), harbored in genes implicated in the etiology of ADHD (ADGRL3, DRD4, and FGF1), with cognitive endophenotypes related to working memory and perceptual organization in 113 nuclear families.

Preadult polytoxicomania—strong environmental underpinnings and first genetic hints,"Steixner-Kumar, A.A.; Daguano Gastaldi, V.; Seidel, J.; Rosenberger, A.; Begemann, M.; Ehrenreich, H.","Considering the immense societal and personal costs and suffering associated with multiple drug use or “polytoxicomania”, better understanding of environmental and genetic causes is crucial. While previous studies focused on single risk factors and selected drugs, effects of early-accumulated environmental risks on polytoxicomania were never addressed. Similarly, evidence of genetic susceptibility to particular drugs is abundant, while genetic predisposition to polytoxicomania is unexplored. We exploited the GRAS data collection, comprising information on N~2000 deep-phenotyped schizophrenia patients, to investigate effects of early-life environmental risk accumulation on polytoxicomania and additionally provide first genetic insight. Preadult accumulation of environmental risks (physical or sexual abuse, urbanicity, migration, cannabis, alcohol) was strongly associated with lifetime polytoxicomania (p = 1.5 × 10−45; OR = 31.4), preadult polytoxicomania with OR = 226.6 (p = 1.0 × 10−33) and adult polytoxicomania with OR = 17.5 (p = 3.4 × 10−24). Parallel accessibility of genetic data from GRAS patients and N~2100 controls for genome-wide association (GWAS) and phenotype-based genetic association studies (PGAS) permitted the creation of a novel multiple GWAS–PGAS approach. This approach yielded 41 intuitively interesting SNPs, potentially conferring liability to preadult polytoxicomania, which await replication upon availability of suitable deep-phenotyped cohorts anywhere world-wide. Concisely, juvenile environmental risk accumulation, including cannabis and alcohol as starter/gateway drugs, strongly predicts polytoxicomania during adolescence and adulthood.

One such mechanism may be epigenetic modification, particularly DNA methylation. The IMMP2L gene is located in a critical region for autism susceptibility on chromosome 7q (AUTS1). The level of DNA methylation was assessed by bisulfite sequencing of 87 CpG sites in the IMMP2L gene in 3 families with maternally inherited 7q31.1 microdeletions affecting the IMMP2L gene alone. Bisulfite sequencing revealed comparable levels of DNA methylation in the probands, healthy siblings without microdeletions, and their fathers. In contrast, a reduced DNA methylation index and increased IMMP2L expression were observed in lymphocytes from the healthy mothers compared with the probands. A number of genes were upregulated in the healthy mothers compared to controls and downregulated in probands compared to mothers. These genes were enriched in components of the ribosome and electron transport chain, as well as oxidative phosphorylation and various degenerative conditions. Differential expression in probands and mothers with IMMP2L deletions relative to controls may be due to compensatory processes in healthy mothers with IMMP2L deletions and disturbances of these processes in probands with intellectual disability. The results suggest a possible partial compensation for IMMP2L gene haploinsufficiency in healthy mothers with the 7q31.1 microdeletion by reducing the DNA methylation level. Differential DNA methylation of intragenic CpG sites may affect the phenotypic manifestation of CNVs and explain the incomplete penetrance of chromosomal microdeletions.",2021,,Cytogenetic and Genome Research,161,4,105-119,,10.1159/000514491,,#2145,Vasilyev 2021,"",""
Structural neuroimaging phenotypes of a novel multi-gene risk score in youth bipolar disorder,"Cazes, J.; Dimick, M.K.; Kennedy, K.G.; Fiksenbaum, L.; Zai, C.C.; Patel, R.; Islam, A.H.; Tampakeras, M.; Freeman, N.; Kennedy, J.L.; MacIntosh, B.J.; Goldstein, B.I.","Background: : Bipolar disorder (BD) is among the most heritable psychiatric disorders, particularly in early-onset cases, owing to multiple genes of small effect. Here we examine a multi-gene risk score (MGRS), to address the gap in multi-gene research in early-onset BD. Methods: : MGRS was derived from 34 genetic variants relevant to neuropsychiatric diseases and related systemic processes. Multiple MGRS were calculated across a spectrum of inclusion p-value thresholds, based on allelic associations with BD. Youth participants (123 BD, 103 healthy control [HC]) of European descent were included, of which 101 participants (58 BD, 43 HC) underwent MRI T1-weighted structural neuroimaging. Hierarchical regressions examined for main effects and MGRS-by-diagnosis interaction effects on 6 regions-of-interest (ROIs). Vertex-wise analysis also examined MGRS-by-diagnosis interactions. Results: : MGRS based on allelic association p≤0.60 was most robust, explaining 6.8% of variance (t(226)=3.46, p=.001). There was an MGRS-by-diagnosis interaction effect on ventrolateral prefrontal cortex surface area (vlPFC; β=.21, p=.0007). Higher MGRS was associated with larger vlPFC surface area in BD vs. HC. There were 8 significant clusters in vertex-wise analyses, primarily in fronto-temporal regions, including vlPFC. Limitations: : Cross-sectional design, modest sample size. Conclusions: : There was a diagnosis-by-MGRS interaction effect on vlPFC surface area, a region involved in emotional processing, emotional regulation, and reward response.

We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes- child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3% and 23.0% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies.

Environmental influence is challenging to measure objectively and account for in genetic studies because the necessary large population samples in these studies involve individuals with varying cultures and life experiences, clouding genetic findings. In a unique population with relative sociocultural homogeneity and a narrower range of types of stress experiences, we quantitatively assessed multiple stress dimensions and measured their potential influence in biasing the heritability estimate of depression. We quantified depressive symptoms, major lifetime stressors, current perceived stress, and a culturally specific community stress measure in individuals with depression-related diagnoses and community controls in Old Order Amish and Mennonite populations. Results showed that lifetime stressors measured by lifetime stressor inventory (R2= 0.06, p = 2 × 10−5) and current stress measured by Perceived Stress Scale (R2= 0.13, p < 1 × 10−6) were both associated with current depressive symptoms quantified by Beck Depression Inventory in community controls, but current stress was the only measure associated with current depressive symptoms in individuals with a depression diagnosis, and to a greater degree (R2 = 0.41, p < 1 × 10−6). A novel, culturally specific community stress measure demonstrated internal reliability and was associated with current stress but was not significantly related to depression. Heritability (h2) for depression diagnosis (0.46 ± 0.14) and quantitative depression severity as measured by Beck Depression Inventory (0.45 ± 0.12) were significant, but h2 for depression diagnosis decreased to 0.25 ± 0.14 once stressors were accounted for in the model.

Long-term effects of early treatment with SSRIs on cognition and brain development in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"Mancini, V.; Maeder, J.; Bortolin, K.; Schneider, M.; Schaer, M.; Eliez, S.","Cognitive deficits in individuals at risk of psychosis represent a significant challenge for research, as current strategies for symptomatic treatment are often ineffective. Recent studies showed that atypical cognitive development predicts the occurrence of psychotic symptoms. Additionally, abnormal brain development is known to predate clinical manifestations of psychosis. Therefore, critical developmental stages may be the best period for early interventions expected to prevent cognitive decline and protect brain maturation. However, it is challenging to identify and treat individuals at risk of psychosis in the general population before the onset of the first psychotic symptoms. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), the neurogenetic disorder with the highest genetic risk for schizophrenia, provides the opportunity to prospectively study the development of subjects at risk for psychosis. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to establish if early treatment with SSRIs in children and adolescents with 22q11DS was associated with long-term effects on cognition and brain development. We included 98 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of 22q11DS followed up 2–4 times (age range: 10–32). Thirty subjects without psychiatric disorders never received psychotropic medications, thirty had psychotic symptoms but were not treated with SSRIs, and 38 received SSRIs treatment. An increase in IQ scores characterized the developmental trajectories of participants receiving treatment with SSRIs, even those with psychotic symptoms. The thickness of frontal regions and hippocampal volume were also relatively increased. The magnitude of the outcomes was inversely correlated to the age at the onset of the treatment. We provide preliminary evidence that early long-term treatment with SSRIs may attenuate the cognitive decline associated with psychosis in 22q11DS and developmental brain abnormalities.",2021,,Translational Psychiatry,11,1,,,10.1038/s41398-021-01456-x,,#2157,Mancini 2021,"",""
The 5-HTTLPR-rs25531 S-A-S-A Haplotype and Chronic Stress Moderate the Association Between Acute Stress and Internalizing Mental Disorders Among HIV+ Children and Adolescents in Uganda,"Kalungi, A.; Womersley, J.S.; Kinyanda, E.; Joloba, M.L.; Ssembajjwe, W.; Nsubuga, R.N.; Seedat, S.; Hemmings, S.M.J.","Background: Internalizing mental disorders (IMDs) among HIV-positive (HIV+) children and adolescents are associated with poor disease outcomes, such as faster HIV disease progression. Although it has been suggested that the development of IMDs is moderated by interaction of stressful life events and vulnerability factors, the underlying etiology is largely unknown. Serotonin transporter gene [solute carrier family 6 member A4 (SLC6A4)] and human tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2) polymorphisms have been implicated in the development of IMDs. This study investigated the association between acute stress and IMDs, and moderation by chronic stress and genetic variants in SLC6A4 and TPH2. Hypothesis: Acute stress acts through genetic and environmental vulnerability factors to increase the risk of developing IMDs. Methods: Polymorphisms in SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR, rs25531, 5-HTTLPR-rs25531, and STin2 VNTR) and TPH2 (rs1843809, rs1386494, rs4570625, and rs34517220) were genotyped in 368 HIV+ children and adolescents (aged 5–17 years) with any internalizing mental disorder (depression, anxiety disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder), and 368 age- and sex-matched controls, who were also HIV+. Chronic and acute stress categories were derived by hierarchical cluster analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent moderating effect of chronic stress and each selected polymorphism on the association between acute stress and IMDs. Results: We observed a statistically significant association between severe acute stress and IMDs (p = 0.001). Children and adolescents who experienced severe acute stress were twice as likely to develop IMDs, compared to children and adolescents who experienced mild acute stress (p = 0.001). Chronic stress interacted with severe acute stress to increase the risk of IMDs (p = 0.033). Acute stress was found to interact with 5-HTTLPR-rs25531 S-A-S-A haplotype to increase the risk for IMDs among Ugandan HIV+ children and adolescents (p = 0.049). We found no evidence for a combined interaction of acute stress, chronic stress, and 5-HTTLPR-rs25531 on IMDs. Conclusion: The odds of having an internalizing mental disorder (IMD) were higher among HIV+ children and adolescents who experienced severe acute stress compared to HIV+ children and adolescents who experienced mild acute stress.

Machine learning analysis was performed for 220 EEG measures, 149 alcohol-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a recent large Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of alcohol use/misuse and two family history (mother DSM-5 AUD and father DSM-5 AUD) features using supervised, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to test which features assessed before developing AUD predict those who go on to develop AUD. Age, gender, and ancestry stratified analyses were performed. Results indicate significant and higher accuracy rates for the AA compared with the EA prediction models and a higher model accuracy trend among females compared with males for both ancestries. Combined EEG and SNP features model outperformed models based on only EEG features or only SNP features for both EA and AA samples. This multidimensional superiority was confirmed in a follow-up analysis in the AA age groups (12–15, 16–19, 20–30) and EA age group (16–19). In both ancestry samples, the youngest age group achieved higher accuracy score than the two other older age groups. Maternal AUD increased the model’s accuracy in both ancestries’ samples.

Genetics of adolescent suicide: A literature review,"Mathew, A.; Nebhinani, N.; Begum, S.; Vijayakumar, K.; Banerjee, M.","Adolescent suicidal behavior is a global public health issue; however, genetic studies are sparse and diverse. A review of the current knowledge on the genetics of adolescent suicide based on an electronic search of two databases is being presented, following PRISMA guidelines. After identification, screening, and exclusion, 17full-text articles based on original studies were included for the review. Studies indicate significant heritability for suicidal behavior. Aggression was found to be associated with higher rates of suicide attempts within families. Possible genetic variants, environmental changes, their interaction, and the timing of these interactions appear to be critical in deciding the suicidal behavior. Several candidate genes and pathways have been implicated with a focus on neurotransmitters, neurotrophic processes, stress response system, and the immune system. From the results, the serotonergic system seems to be the most plausible system explaining anxiety, impulsivity, depressed mood, and adolescent suicidal behavior. However, inconsistencies for serotonergic genes were also reported for adolescent suicidal behavior which largely reflected the ethnic and phenotypic variation. The serotonin transporter variant was significantly associated with depression and suicide attempts while serotonin receptor gene variants were significantly associated with suicide ideation. Tryptophan hydroxylase variant had a significant association with suicide attempts, hopelessness, and impulsivity scores. Majority of the studies had a small sample size, and the lack of consensus on genetic studies reflected the phenotypic and ethnic variation.

The Burden of Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and Metabolic Syndrome in Children,"Libowitz, M.R.; Nurmi, E.L.","Antipsychotic medications are critical to child and adolescent psychiatry, from the stabilization of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression to behavioral treatment of autism spectrum disorder, tic disorders, and pediatric aggression. While effective, these medications carry serious risk of adverse events—most commonly, weight gain and cardiometabolic abnormalities. Negative metabolic consequences affect up to 60% of patients and present a major obstacle to long-term treatment. Since antipsychotics are often chronically prescribed beginning in childhood, cardiometabolic risk accumulates. An increased susceptibility to antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) has been repeatedly documented in children, particularly rapid weight gain. Associated cardiometabolic abnormalities include central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation. Lifestyle interventions and medications such as metformin have been proposed to reduce risk but remain limited in efficacy. Furthermore, antipsychotic medications touted to be weight-neutral in adults can cause substantial weight gain in children. A better understanding of the biological underpinnings of AIWG could inform targeted and potentially more fruitful treatments; however, little is known about the underlying mechanism. As yet, modest genetic studies have nominated a few risk genes that explain only a small percentage of the risk. Recent investigations have begun to explore novel potential mechanisms of AIWG, including a role for gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. This article reviews the problem of AIWG and AP metabolic side effects in pediatric populations, proposed mechanisms underlying this serious side effect, and strategies to mitigate adverse impact.

The Efficacy of Combining 308 Nm-Excimer Light and Topical Steroid in the Treatment of Alopecia Areata,"","Brief SummaryAlopecia areata is a polygenic autoimmune disease causing hair loss, particularly during the anagen phase of hair growth This condition has a lifetime risk of about 2.1% of the world population and the cumulative incidence seems to rise linearly with age . Patchy non scarring hair loss on the scalp is the most common clinical presentation, although it can also occur elsewhere . In addition to patchy Alopecia Areata , a more severe form, alopecia totalis , presents with diffuse hair loss across the scalp. In the most severe form, alopecia universalis , hair loss occurs on all areas of the body, including the beard, eyelashes, and extremities .Detailed DescriptionAlopecia Areata can have a large impact on patients' quality of life, causing both cosmetic and psychosocial distress. Studies on the impact of hair loss have shown high levels of self-consciousness, jealousy, embarrassment, depression, introversion, and decreased self-esteem . Alopecia Areata can occur at any age, but it is most common among young and middle-aged people . Both sexes are equally affected. Several environmental factors have been suggested as triggering Alopecia Areata, including infection, drugs, trauma, and stress. Thyroid autoimmune disease, atopy, and vitiligo are commonly associated. Diverse physical or psychological insults may trigger the episodes of Alopecia Areata, but there is no evidence that they influence prognosis. Etiology of Alopecia Areata is not completely understood, and the majority of evidence suggests that genetically predisposed individuals, when exposed to an unknown trigger, develop a predominantly autoimmune reaction, leading to acute hair loss. Although many patients improve spontaneously or respond to standard therapy, treatment can be quite challenging in those with more severe and refractory disease . Topical corticosteroids are often the first line of treatment for mild patchy alopecia, with the underlying mechanism being containment of inflammation and hastening of the recovery of damaged hair follicles . Additionally, corticosteroids may be delivered via intralesional injection with slightly better effects (63% with complete regrowth within 4 months in one study . However, this method cannot be used for rapidly progressing variants and does not prevent hair loss at other sites . Furthermore, both topical and intralesional steroids increase the risk of cutaneous atrophy at the site of treatment, and intralesional steroids may decrease bone mineral density . With the development of new technologies, more and more lasers or lamps have been used to treat alopecia, such as ultraviolet , Excimer laser/lamp , low-level laser , erbium-glass laser, thulium laser , and carbon dioxide laser . Individual researchers have been considering 308-nm Excimer lamp to be used for treating Alopecia Areata by inducing apoptosis of T lymphocytes, but the effective rates had differences in studies . Excimer laser using high-dose monochromatic UV radiation can trigger apoptosis and induce immunological suppression through altering cytokine production such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10, prostaglandin E2, platelet-activating factor, and cis-urocanic acid .",2021,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2178,,"",""

SETD1B encodes a lysine-specific methyltransferase that assists in transcriptional activation of genes by depositing H3K4 methyl marks. Previous reports of patients with rare variants in SETD1B describe a distinctive phenotype that includes seizures, global developmental delay and intellectual disability. Methods Two of the patients described herein were identified via genome-wide and exome-wide testing, with microarray and research-based exome, through the CAUSES (Clinical Assessment of the Utility of Sequencing and Evaluation as a Service) Research Clinic at the University of British Columbia. The third Vancouver patient had clinical trio exome sequencing through Blueprint Genetics. The fourth patient underwent singleton exome sequencing in Nantes, with subsequent recruitment to this cohort through GeneMatcher. Results Here we present clinical reports of four patients with rare coding variants in SETD1B that demonstrate a shared phenotype, including intellectual disability, language delay, conserved musculoskeletal findings and seizures that may be treatment-refractory. We include supporting evidence from next-generation sequencing among a cohort of paediatric patients with epilepsy. Conclusion Rare coding variants in SETD1B can cause a diagnosable syndrome and could contribute as a risk factor for epilepsy, autism and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In the long term, some patients may also be at increased risk for cancers and other complex diseases. Thus, longitudinal studies are required to further elucidate the precise role of SETD1B in neurodevelopmental disorders and other systemic disease.",2021,,Journal of Medical Genetics,58,3,196-204,,10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106756,,#2182,Roston 2021,"",""
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (Nows): A transgenerational echo of the opioid crisis,"Weller, A.E.; Crist, R.C.; Reiner, B.C.; Doyle, G.A.; Berrettini, W.H.","The incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) has increased substantially in the setting of the opioid epidemic, a major public health problem in the United States. At present, NOWS has commonly used assessment and treatment protocols, but new protocols have questioned old practices. However, because of limited access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and socioeconomic factors, many pregnant (and postpartum) women with OUD do not receive treatment. The pathophysiology of NOWS is not completely understood, although limited research studies have been conducted in humans and animals to better understand its etiology. Moreover, there is evidence that epigenetic and genetic factors play a role in the development of NOWS, but further study is needed. Animal models have suggested that there are deleterious effects of in utero opioid exposure later in life. Clinical research has revealed the harmful long-term sequelae of NOWS, with respect to cognitive function and childhood development. Many psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence, so as infants born with NOWS approach adolescence, additional clinical and molecular studies are warranted to identify biologic and psychosocial risk factors and long-term effects of NOWS.

Pharmacotherapeutic options for kidney disease in HIV positive patients,"Tariq, A.; Kim, H.; Abbas, H.; Lucas, G.M.; Atta, M.G.","Introduction: Since the developmentof combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-associated mortality and the incidence of HIV-associated end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has decreased. However, in the United States, an increase in non-HIV-associated kidney diseases within the HIV-positive population is expected. Areas Covered: In this review, the authors highlight the risk factors for kidney disease within an HIV-positive population and provide the current recommendations for risk stratification and for the monitoring of its progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as, treatment. The article is based on literature searches using PubMed, Medline and SCOPUS. Expert opinion: The authors recommend clinicians (1) be aware of early cART initiation to prevent and treat HIV-associated kidney diseases, (2) be aware of cART side effects and discriminate those that may become more nephrotoxic than others and require dose-adjustment in the setting of eGFR ≤ 30ml/min/1.73m2, (3) follow KDIGO guidelines regarding screening and monitoring for CKD with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, (4) manage other co-infections and comorbidities, (5) consider changing cART if drug induced toxicity is established with apparent eGFR decline of ≥ 10ml/min/1.73m2 or rising creatinine (≥0.5mg/dl) during drug–drug interactions, and (6) strongly consider kidney transplant in appropriately selected individuals with end stage kidney failure.",2021,,Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy,22,1,69-82,,10.1080/14656566.2020.1817383,,#2189,Tariq 2021,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

We performed a genome-wide study assessing baseline differences in DNA methylation between Responders and NonResponders. Patients and Methods: Twenty-two children and adolescents, receiving fluoxetine treatment for the first time, were classified as Responders or Non-Responders according to CGI-I score after 8 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit and analyzed using the Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline (ChAMP). Results: We identified 21 CpG sites significantly (FDR<0.05) associated with fluoxetine response that showed meaningful differences (Δβ> ±0.2) in methylation level between Responders and Non-Responders. Two genes, RHOJ (Ras Homolog Family Member J) and OR2L13 (Olfactory Receptor family 2 subfamily L member 13), presented more than one significant CpG sites.

Objective: Present study was undertaken to assess awareness, social impact, degree of stigma and management approaches among local AA patients. Methods: The study was cross-sectional & conducted in Dermatology Department of Government General Hospital, Ghulam Muhammad Abad, Faisalabad. The duration of study was six months i.e. from February 2019 to July 2019 recruiting 50 patients. A questionnaire was designed and distributed among participants recruited through convenient sampling method to collect baseline information such as age, gender, age at onset, duration of AA, marital status, education along with knowledge, perceptions and behavior based-queries. Results: With average age of 27.5±2.92 years, 74% participants were male. About 90% participants were married and only 3% were graduates. Majority (62%) had no knowledge about causes of AA. When asked about causative factors, almost 42% of the participants believed that germs and viruses may cause AA. Although family life of 56% respondents was unaffected by disease, yet social life of 66% patients suffered from AA. Depression was experienced by 48% subjects. Availability of economical treatment options was in the knowledge of 50-70% respondents.

Differential Associations of Distress Tolerance and Anxiety Sensitivity With Adolescent Internalizing Psychopathology,"Qi, J.; Rappaport, L.M.; Cecilione, J.; Hettema, J.M.; Roberson-Nay, R.","Distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity may differentiate among internalizing disorders, though few studies have examined differential associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms while adjusting for their intercorrelation. In an adolescent genetic epidemiological sample (ages 15-21), the present study (N = 848, 56.97% female) examined concurrent associations of distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general stress) at baseline and prospective, predictive associations of baseline distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity with internalizing psychopathology at 2-year follow-up. In addition, the present study assessed distress tolerance with two laboratory-based tasks, a carbon dioxide challenge and the mirror-tracing task, to distinguish between tolerance of physiological and cognitive distress, respectively. Elevated anxiety sensitivity was broadly associated with elevated symptoms of internalizing psychopathology at baseline and prospectively predicted elevated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 2-year follow-up. Higher tolerance of cognitive distress was associated with lower concurrent anxiety symptoms but not with anxiety symptoms at follow-up.

Few studies have investigated whether this is reflected in hospital admissions for endogenous endophthalmitis. Objective: To report changing trends in epidemiology, risk factors, hospital course, and costs associated with drug use-related endogenous endophthalmitis hospitalizations in the United States from 2003 to 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Inpatient Sample. A total of 56839 patients admitted with a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis were included. Data were analyzed between 2003 and 2016. Exposures: Inpatient admission for endogenous endophthalmitis during the years 2003 to 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried to identify all inpatient admissions with a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis in the United States between the years 2003 and 2016. Analyses were performed to identify national and regional trends in incidence and prevalence of associated infectious and noninfectious comorbidities in patients with or without a history of drug dependence or use. Median and cumulative inflation-adjusted costs for admissions were calculated. Results: Of all patients, 55.6% were White, 13.6% were Black, and 10.6% were Hispanic. There were an estimated 56839 endogenous endophthalmitis-related hospitalizations; 13.7% of these patients (n = 7783) had a history of drug dependence or use. The drug-using population was significantly younger (49.6 vs 57.5 years; difference, 7.9; 95% CI, 6.93-8.88; P <.001) and more likely to be male (61.8% [n = 35 127] vs 49.0% [n = 21 712]; difference, 12.8%; 95% CI, 11.6%-14.0%; P <.001).

Obesity: Diagnosis and treatment,"Milano, W.; Ambrosio, P.; Carizzone, F.; De Biasio, V.; Capasso, A.","Obesity is a condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat, generally due to incorrect nutrition and a sedentary life, which can adversely affect both the quality and life expectancy. In recent years, awareness has grown that a balanced weight is a necessary condition for good physical and mental health. On a psychological level, in fact, obesity can completely upset a person's life: those who are obese are often isolated and can run into anxiety and depression. In particular, overweight children tend to develop a difficult relationship with their body and with their peers, with consequent isolation which often results in further sedentary habits. We are studying whether and to what extent obesity can also be the result of genetic risk factors. Although studies are still preliminary, given the multifactorial nature of obesity, it is likely that there are combined genetic factors capable of promoting or not the ability to lose weight and keep it low. Other health problems associated with excess body weight are: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, sleep apnea and respiratory problems, asthma, increased surgical risk, complications in pregnancy, hirsutism and menstrual irregularities. A particularly serious problem is that of the onset of obesity among children and adolescents, exposed since childhood to respiratory difficulties, joint problems, reduced mobility, but also digestive and psychological disorders. Those who are obese in childhood are often obese as adults: the risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, coronary heart disease, tendency to heart attack) and conditions of impaired metabolism, such as type 2 diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. The main treatment is prevention: in order to control your weight, you need to adopt healthy lifestyles, i.e. proper nutrition and adequate physical activity. In the diagnosis of obesity and especially in all subsequent therapies and dietary treatments, it is necessary to avoid self-diagnosis, but to rely on a specialist. The treatment consists in reducing body weight, under close medical supervision and in specialized centers and in maintaining a weight appropriate to one's height. Alongside the diet, which must be studied on the individual, physical activity (appropriate to the type of patient) and possibly also behavioral therapy must be combined. Below we report a brief summary of pharmacotherapy for the reduction of body weight.",2020,,Pharmacologyonline,3,"(Milano W., wamilano@tin.it; Ambrosio P.; Carizzone F.; De Biasio V.)

Without early identification and treatment, eating disorders may run a long-term course. OBJECTIVE To characterize any associations among disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) and other mental health disorders and to identify early associations with the development of symptoms over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter, population-based, longitudinal cohort study used data from baseline (collected in 2010), follow-up 1 (collected in 2012), and follow-up 2 (collected in 2015) of the IMAGEN Study, which included adolescents recruited from 8 European sites. The present study assessed data from 1623 healthy adolescents, aged 14 years at baseline, recruited from high schools. Data analyses were performed from January 2018 to September 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Body mass index (BMI), mental health symptoms, substance use behaviors, and personality variables were investigated as time-varying associations of DEBs (dieting, binge eating, and purging) or change in BMI over time. Polygenic risk scores were calculated to investigate genetic contributions associated with BMI, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neuroticism to DEBs. RESULTS In this cohort study of 1623 adolescents (829 girls [51.1%]) recruited at a mean (SD) age of 14.5 (0.4) years and followed up at ages 16 and 19 years, 278 adolescents (17.1%) reported binge eating, 334 adolescents (20.6%) reported purging, and 356 adolescents (21.9%) reported dieting at 14, 16, or 19 years. Among the precursors of DEBs, high BMI was associated with future dieting (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.09-5.65). High levels of neuroticism (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06), conduct problems (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17-1.69), and deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.37-3.45) were associated with future binge eating. Low agreeableness (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97), deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.69-3.95), conduct problems (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20-1.68), alcohol misuse (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10-1.54), and drug abuse (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.78-4.74) were associated with future purging. Polygenetic risk scores for BMI were associated with dieting (at 14 years: OR, 1.27; lower bound 95% CI, 1.08; at 16 years: OR, 1.38; lower bound 95% CI, 1.17); ADHD, with purging (at 16 years: OR, 1.25; lower bound 95% CI, 1.08; at 19 years, OR, 1.23; lower bound 95% CI, 1.06); and neuroticism, with binge eating (at 14 years: OR, 1.32; lower bound 95% CI, 1.11; at 16 years: OR, 1.24; lower bound 95% CI, 1.06), highlighting distinct etiologic overlaps between these traits. The DEBs predated other mental health problems, with dieting at 14 years associated with future symptoms of depression (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.56-4.10), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.14-4.51), deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.51-4.24), emotional problems (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43), and smoking (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48). Purging at 14 years was also associated with future depression (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.69-5.01) and anxiety (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.49-4.12) symptoms.

"Genetic factors underlie the association between anxiety, attitudes and performance in mathematics","Malanchini, M.; Rimfeld, K.; Wang, Z.; Petrill, S.A.; Tucker-Drob, E.M.; Plomin, R.; Kovas, Y.","Students struggling with mathematics anxiety (MA) tend to show lower levels of mathematics self-efficacy and interest as well as lower performance. The current study addresses: (1) how MA relates to different aspects of mathematics attitudes (self-efficacy and interest), ability (understanding numbers, problem-solving ability, and approximate number sense) and achievement (exam scores); (2) to what extent these observed relations are explained by overlapping genetic and environmental factors; and (3) the role of general anxiety in accounting for these associations. The sample comprised 3410 twin pairs aged 16–21 years, from the Twins Early Development Study. Negative associations of comparable strength emerged between MA and the two measures of mathematics attitudes, phenotypically (~ −0.45) and genetically (~ −0.70). Moderate negative phenotypic (~ −0.35) and strong genetic (~ −0.70) associations were observed between MA and measures of mathematics performance. The only exception was approximate number sense whose phenotypic (−0.10) and genetic (−0.31) relation with MA was weaker. Multivariate quantitative genetic analyses indicated that all mathematics-related measures combined accounted for ~75% of the genetic variance in MA and ~20% of its environmental variance. Genetic effects were largely shared across all measures of mathematics anxiety, attitudes, abilities and achievement, with the exception of approximate number sense. This genetic overlap was not accounted for by general anxiety.

The influence of common polygenic risk and gene sets on social skills group training response in autism spectrum disorder,"Li, D.; Choque-Olsson, N.; Jiao, H.; Norgren, N.; Jonsson, U.; Bölte, S.; Tammimies, K.","Social skills group training (SSGT) is a frequently used behavioral intervention in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the effects are moderate and heterogeneous. Here, we analyzed the effect of polygenic risk score (PRS) and common variants in gene sets on the intervention outcome. Participants from the largest randomized clinical trial of SSGT in ASD to date were selected (N = 188, 99 from SSGT, 89 from standard care) to calculate association between the outcomes in the SSGT trial and PRSs for ASD, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and educational attainment. In addition, specific gene sets were selected to evaluate their role on intervention outcomes. Among all participants in the trial, higher PRS for ADHD was associated with significant improvement in the outcome measure, the parental-rated Social Responsiveness Scale. The significant association was due to better outcomes in the standard care group for individuals with higher PRS for ADHD (post-intervention: β = −4.747, P = 0.0129; follow-up: β = −5.309, P = 0.0083). However, when contrasting the SSGT and standard care group, an inferior outcome in the SSGT group was associated with higher ADHD PRS at follow-up (β = 6.67, P = 0.016). Five gene sets within the synaptic category showed a nominal association with reduced response to interventions. We provide preliminary evidence that genetic liability calculated from common variants could influence the intervention outcomes.

Methods: Using well defined cohorts of discordant, monozygotic twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry, and case-controlled ADHD cases in adolescents, the present studies utilized advanced single molecule RNA sequencing to identify expressed changes in whole blood RNA in ADHD. Multiple analytical strategies were employed to narrow differentially expressed RNA targets to a small set of potential biomarkers of ADHD. Results: RNA markers common to both the discordant twin study and case-controlled subjects further narrowed the putative targets, some of which had been previously associated with ADHD at the DNA level. The potential role of several differentially expressed genes, including ABCB5, RGS2, GAK, GIT1 and 3 members of the galactose metabolism pathway (GALE, GALT, GALK1) are substantiated by prior associations to ADHD and by established mechanistic connections to molecular pathways relevant to ADHD and behavioral control.

Observational literature has shown that educational attainment (EA) and cognitive performance (CP) influence suicide attempt risk; however, the causal nature of these relationships is unknown. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of EA, CP, and suicide attempt risk with > 815,000 combined white participants of European ancestry, we performed multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to disentangle the effects of EA and CP on attempted suicide. In single-variable MR (SVMR), EA and CP appeared to reduce suicide attempt risk (EA odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in EA (4.2 years), 0.524, 95% CI, 0.412–0.666, P = 1.07 × 10−7; CP OR per SD increase in standardized score, 0.714, 95% CI, 0.577–0.885, P = 0.002). Conversely, bidirectional analyses found no effect of a suicide attempt on EA or CP. Using various multivariable MR (MVMR) models, EA seems to be the predominant risk factor for suicide attempt risk with the independent effect (OR, 0.342, 95% CI, 0.206–0.568, P = 1.61 × 10−4), while CP had no effect (OR, 1.182, 95% CI, 0.842–1.659, P = 0.333). In additional MVMR analyses accounting simultaneously for potential behavioral and psychiatric mediators (tobacco smoking; alcohol consumption; and self-reported nerves, tension, anxiety, or depression), the effect of EA was little changed (OR, 0.541, 95% CI, 0.421–0.696, P = 3.33 × 10−6). Consistency of results across complementary MR methods accommodating different assumptions about genetic pleiotropy strengthened causal inference.

However, the extent to which epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the etiology of the disorder is unknown. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium to identify DNA methylation sites associated with ADHD symptoms at two methylation assessment periods: birth and school age. We examined associations of both DNA methylation in cord blood with repeatedly assessed ADHD symptoms (age 4–15 years) in 2477 children from 5 cohorts and of DNA methylation at school age with concurrent ADHD symptoms (age 7–11 years) in 2374 children from 9 cohorts, with 3 cohorts participating at both timepoints. CpGs identified with nominal significance (p < 0.05) in either of the EWAS were correlated between timepoints (ρ = 0.30), suggesting overlap in associations; however, top signals were very different. At birth, we identified nine CpGs that predicted later ADHD symptoms (p < 1 × 10–7), including ERC2 and CREB5. Peripheral blood DNA methylation at one of these CpGs (cg01271805 in the promoter region of ERC2, which regulates neurotransmitter release) was previously associated with brain methylation. Another (cg25520701) lies within the gene body of CREB5, which previously was associated with neurite outgrowth and an ADHD diagnosis. In contrast, at school age, no CpGs were associated with ADHD with p < 1 × 10−7. In conclusion, we found evidence in this study that DNA methylation at birth is associated with ADHD.

Identifying neurodevelopmental anomalies of white matter microstructure associated with high risk for psychosis in 22q11.2DS,"Bagautdinova, J.; Padula, M.C.; Zöller, D.; Sandini, C.; Schneider, M.; Schaer, M.; Eliez, S.","Disruptions of white matter microstructure have been widely reported in schizophrenia. However, the emergence of these alterations during preclinical stages remains poorly understood. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) represents a unique model to study the interplay of different risk factors that may impact neurodevelopment in premorbid psychosis. To identify the impact of genetic predisposition for psychosis on white matter development, we acquired longitudinal MRI data in 201 individuals (22q11.2DS = 101; controls = 100) aged 5–35 years with 1–3 time points and reconstructed 18 white matter tracts using TRACULA. Mixed model regression was used to characterize developmental trajectories of four diffusion measures—fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) in each tract. To disentangle the impact of additional environmental and developmental risk factors on white matter maturation, we used a multivariate approach (partial least squares (PLS) correlation) in a subset of 39 individuals with 22q11.2DS. Results revealed no divergent white matter developmental trajectories in patients with 22q11.2DS compared to controls. However, 22q11.2DS showed consistently increased FA and reduced AD, RD, and MD in most white matter tracts. PLS correlation further revealed a significant white matter-clinical risk factors relationship. These results indicate that while age-related changes are preserved in 22q11.2DS, white matter microstructure is widely disrupted, suggesting that genetic high risk for psychosis involves early occurring neurodevelopmental insults. In addition, multivariate modeling showed that clinical risk factors further impact white matter development. Together, these findings suggest that genetic, developmental, and environmental risk factors may play a cumulative role in altering normative white matter development during premorbid stages of psychosis.",2020,,Translational Psychiatry,10,1,,,10.1038/s41398-020-01090-z,,#2218,Bagautdinova 2020,"",""
Developmental effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the human frontal cortex transcriptome,"Semick, S.A.; Collado-Torres, L.; Markunas, C.A.; Shin, J.H.; Deep-Soboslay, A.; Tao, R.; Huestis, M.A.; Bierut, L.J.; Maher, B.S.; Johnson, E.O.; Hyde, T.M.; Weinberger, D.R.; Hancock, D.B.; Kleinman, J.E.; Jaffe, A.E.","Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a major public health concern. While there are well-described consequences in early child development, there is very little known about the effects of maternal smoking on human cortical biology during prenatal life. We therefore performed a genome-wide differential gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on prenatal (N = 33; 16 smoking-exposed) as well as adult (N = 207; 57 active smokers) human postmortem prefrontal cortices. Smoking exposure during the prenatal period was directly associated with differential expression of 14 genes; in contrast, during adulthood, despite a much larger sample size, only two genes showed significant differential expression (FDR < 10%). Moreover, 1,315 genes showed significantly different exposure effects between maternal smoking during pregnancy and direct exposure in adulthood (FDR < 10%)—these differences were largely driven by prenatal differences that were enriched for pathways previously implicated in addiction and synaptic function. Furthermore, prenatal and age-dependent differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes implicated in non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and were differentially expressed as a set between patients with ASD and controls in postmortem cortical regions. These results underscore the enhanced sensitivity to the biological effect of smoking exposure in the developing brain and offer insight into how maternal smoking during pregnancy affects gene expression in the prenatal human cortex.

"An Observational Study of the Developing Brain, Impulsivity and Compulsivity","","Brief SummaryBackground: Impulsivity is acting 'without thinking.' Compulsivity is being overly inflexible. People vary in how impulsive or compulsive they are. Extreme versions of these behaviors play a role in mental disorders. Researchers want to study changes in the brain to learn more about these behaviors. Differences in genes may also play a role. Objective: To learn about genetic \& brain features that explain why levels of impulsivity and compulsivity vary across people. Eligibility: People ages 6 - 80 Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history and medical record review. Participants will talk about their mental and behavioral development. They may discuss topics like drug use and sexual activity. They will complete surveys about their compulsivity and impulsivity. Parents of child participants may also complete these surveys. Participants may take memory, attention, and thinking tests. They may give blood or saliva samples for gene studies. Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. It will take pictures of their brain. The scanner is shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. A coil will be placed over their head. They will lie still, watch a movie, and play a game. Participants may have a magnetoencephalography scan. It records brain activity. Participants will sit in a room. A ""cone"" of magnetic field detectors will be lowered around their head. They will rest and play a game. Participants may ask family members to join the study. Participants under age 25 may repeat these tests every 1-2 years until they turn 25 or until the study ends. For those over age 25, participation will last less than 1 month.Detailed DescriptionStudy Description: Many neuropsychiatric disorders have extreme impairing impulsivity and compulsivity behaviors at their core. We hypothesized that the development of symptoms of impulsivity and compulsivity during childhood/adolescence and early adulthood will be associated with atypical trajectories of brain features including cortical glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter) and functional/structural brain connectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize that cortical glutamate will be under genetic control (i.e., heritable) and that common genetic variant risk for disorders characterized by extreme impulsivity (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and by extreme compulsivity (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder) will also be associated with atypical cortical glutamate trajectories. To elucidate the relationships between the developing brain, compulsivity/impulsivity and genomics, we will collect clinical assessments including clinician-led interviews, neurobehavioral assessments, neuroimaging data, and genomic samples using 1) a prospective longitudinal design to answer developmental hypotheses; 2) an extended multigenerational family design to assess genomic hypotheses. Objectives: Primary Objective: A) To assess the effects of impulsivity and compulsivity on the developmental trajectories of cortical glutamate. B) To determine the heritability of cortical glutamate. Secondary Objectives: A) To establish the reliability of glutamate measurements. B) To examine the impact of atypical glutamate levels on developing structural and functional connections within the fronto-striatal circuits. Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: A) Age-related change in cortical glutamate levels and its moderation by individual differences in levels of impulsivity and compulsivity. B) Heritability of cortical glutamate (proportion of variance explained by additive genetic factors). Secondary Endpoints: A) 1. Glutamate levels estimated at 3 Tesla at short intervals to establish test-retest reliability. 2. Glutamate levels estimated at both 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla (cross scanner validation). B) Measures of the brain s structural and functional connectivity. Study Population: We aim to recruit 1100 participants over the next 7 years. Individuals between 6 and 80 years of age with a wide range of impulsivity/compulsivity behaviors - ranging from normal to mildly/extremely impaired - will be recruited. No specific demographic groups will be targeted. Recruitment will be mainly done in the District of Columbia/Maryland/Virginia area, however some participants needed for primary aim B (heritability) might travel from elsewhere. Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The National Institute of Health is the sole site for enrollment of participant. Study Duration: The estimated study duration from the beginning of the study (study opens to enrollment) to the end (completion of data analyses) is 10 years. Participant Duration: Primary Objective A: Participants may complete follow-up visits for as long as the study is open; thus, they might complete visits over a 7 to 10-year period. Primary Objective B: Participants will complete the study after one visit and may complete forms at home; thus, the estimated time for participation is less than a month.",2020,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2223,,"",""

With this respect, epigenetic mechanisms play a key role for the long-lasting changes in brain functions that may elicit and sustain psychopathologic outcomes. Here, we investigated DNA methylation changes as possible epigenetic mechanism mediating the effect of prenatal stress (PNS), an experimental paradigm associated with behavioral and molecular alterations relevant for psychiatric disorders. We identified 138 genes as being differentially methylated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in the hippocampus (HIP) of male and female adult rats exposed to PNS. Among these genes, miR-30a and Neurod1 emerged as potential players for the negative outcomes associated with PNS exposure. Indeed, in addition to showing consistent methylation differences in both brain regions and in both sexes, and interacting with each other, they are both involved in Axon guidance and Neurotrophin signaling, which are important to neurodevelopmental disorders. We also found a significant reduction in the expression of a panel of genes (CAMK2A, c-JUN, LIMK1, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, PIK3CA and PLCG1) that belong to these two biological pathways and are also validated targets of miR-30a, pointing to a down-regulation of these pathways as a consequence of PNS exposure. Interestingly, we also found that miR-30a levels were significantly upregulated in depressed patients exposed to childhood trauma, as compared to control individuals. Importantly, we also found that a sub-chronic treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drug, lurasidone, during adolescence was able to prevent the up-regulation of miR-30a and normalized the expression of its target genes in response to PNS exposure. Our results demonstrate that miR-30a undergoes epigenetic changes following early life stress exposure and suggest that this miRNA could play a key role in producing broad and long-lasting alterations in neuroplasticity-related pathways, contributing to the etiology of psychiatric disorders.",2020,,Neurobiology of Stress,13,"(Cattaneo A.; Mazzelli M.; Begni V.; Luoni A.; Riva M.A., m.riva@unimi.it) Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan, via Balzaretti 9, Milan, Italy(Cattaneo A.; Cattane N.; Mazzelli M.; D'Aprile I.)

We addressed concerns about the prognostic significance of adolescent borderline pathology by testing whether borderline symptoms at age 12 years predict functioning during the transition to adulthood, at age 18 years, in areas critical to life-course development. Method: We studied members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the development of a birth cohort of 2,232 British twin children. At age 12, study members' borderline symptoms were measured using mothers’ reports. At age 18, study members’ personality, psychopathology, functional outcomes, and experiences of victimization were measured using self-reports, coinformant reports, and official records. Results: At age 18, study members who had more borderline symptoms at age 12 were more likely to have difficult personalities, to struggle with poor mental health, to experience poor functional outcomes, and to have become victims of violence. Reports of poor outcomes were corroborated by coinformants and official records. Borderline symptoms in study members at 12 years old predicted poor outcomes over and above other behavioral and emotional problems during adolescence. Twin analyses showed that borderline symptoms in 12-year-olds were influenced by familial risk, particularly genetic risk, which accounted for associations with most poor outcomes at age 18. Conclusion: Borderline symptoms in 12-year-olds signal risk for pervasive poor functioning during the transition to adulthood. This association is driven by genetic influences, suggesting that borderline symptoms and poor outcomes are manifestations of shared genetic risk.",2020,,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,59,10,1165-1177.e2,,10.1016/j.jaac.2019.07.005,,#2231,Wertz 2020,"",""

"Polygenic prediction and GWAS of depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation/self-harm in a Peruvian cohort","Shen, H.; Gelaye, B.; Huang, H.; Rondon, M.B.; Sanchez, S.; Duncan, L.E.","Genome-wide approaches including polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are now widely used in medical research; however, few studies have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in South America.

The PrOMIS cohort (N = 3308) was recruited from prenatal care clinics at the Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal (INMP) in Lima, Peru. Three major psychiatric outcomes (depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation and/or self-harm) were scored by interviewers using valid Spanish questionnaires. Illumina Multi-Ethnic Global chip was used for genotyping. Standard procedures for PRSs and GWAS were used along with extra steps to rule out confounding due to ancestry.

The associations were robust to sensitivity analyses using more homogeneous subgroups of participants and alternative choices of principal components. Successful polygenic prediction of three psychiatric phenotypes in this Peruvian cohort suggests that genetic influences on depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation/self-harm are at least partially shared across global populations.

Polygenic risk for autism spectrum disorder associates with anger recognition in a neurodevelopment-focused phenome-wide scan of unaffected youths from a population-based cohort,"Wendt, F.R.; Carvalho, C.M.; Pathak, G.A.; Gelernter, J.; Polimanti, R.","The polygenic nature and the contribution of common genetic variation to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) allude to a high degree of pleiotropy between ASD and other psychiatric and behavioral traits. In a pleiotropic system, a single genetic variant contributes small effects to several phenotypes or disorders. While analyzed broadly, there is a paucity of research studies investigating the shared genetic information between specific neurodevelopmental domains and ASD. We performed a phenome-wide association study of ASD polygenetic risk score (PRS) against 491 neurodevelopmental subdomains ascertained in 4,309 probands from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) who lack an ASD diagnosis. Our main analysis calculated ASD PRS in 4,309 PNC probands using the per-SNP effects reported in a recent genome-wide association study of ASD in a case-control design. In a high-resolution manner, our main analysis regressed ASD PRS against 491 neurodevelopmental phenotypes with age, sex, and ten principal components of ancestry as covariates. Follow-up analyses included in the regression model PRS derived from brain-related traits genetically correlated with ASD. Our main finding demonstrated that 11-17-year old probands with the highest ASD genetic risk were able to identify angry faces (R2 = 1.06%, p = 1.38 × 10−7, pBonferroni-corrected = 1.9 × 10−3).

We also detected several suggestive associations between ASD PRS and emotionality and connectedness with others. These data (i) indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence neurodevelopment in the general population, (ii) reinforce epidemiological findings of heightened ability of ASD cases to predict certain social psychological events based on increased systemizing skills, and (iii) recapitulate theories of imbalance between empathizing and systemizing in ASD etiology.",2020,,PLoS Genetics,16,9,,,10.1371/journal.pgen.1009036,,#2239,Wendt 2020,"",""

Methods: We conducted two epigenome-wide association studies in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (aged 4-18 years) using DNA extracted from saliva. DNAm data generated on the Illumina Human Methylation 450 K array were used to examine the interaction between genetic variation and DNAm patterns associated with these disorders. Results: Using linear regression followed by principal component analysis, individuals with the most endorsed symptoms of ADHD or OCD were found to have significantly more distinct DNAm patterns from controls, as compared to all cases. This suggested that the phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders is reflected in altered DNAm at specific sites. Further investigations of the DNAm sites associated with each disorder revealed that despite little overlap of these DNAm sites across the two disorders, both disorders were significantly enriched for mQTLs within our sample.

The frequencies of the alleles of TPH2 rs11179027 (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.08-2.85, p = 0.022), TPH2 rs1843809 (OR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.82-7.43, p = <0.001), and RELN rs736707 (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.51, p = 0.035) were significantly associated with ADHD, while there was no significant difference between ADHD patients and controls regarding the frequency of RELN rs362691 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.73-2.48, p = 0.34). The frequencies of CTAG, CTGG, CTAC, CTGC, and GTAC haplotypes were significantly higher in ADHD patients than in controls (p = 0.011, 0.005, 0.015, 0.001, and 0.027, respectively).

Longitudinal DNA methylation changes at MET may alter HGF/c-MET signalling in adolescents at risk for depression,"Ciuculete, D.M.; Voisin, S.; Kular, L.; Welihinda, N.; Jonsson, J.; Jagodic, M.; Mwinyi, J.; Schiöth, H.B.","Unrecognized depression during adolescence can result in adult suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to identify, replicate and characterize DNA methylation (DNAm) shifts in depression aetiology, using a longitudinal, multi-tissue (blood and brain) and multi-layered (genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics) approach. We measured genome-wide blood DNAm data at baseline and one-year follow-up, and imputed genetic variants, in 59 healthy adolescents comprising the discovery cohort. Depression and suicidal symptoms were determined using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) depression band, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self (MADRS-S) and SUicide Assessment Scale (SUAS). DNAm levels at follow-up were regressed against depression scores, adjusting for sex, age and the DNAm residuals at baseline. Higher methylation levels of 5% and 13% at cg24627299 within the MET gene were associated with higher depression scores (praw<1e-4) and susceptibility for suicidal symptoms (padj.<0.005). The nearby rs39748 was discovered to be a methylation and expression quantitative trait locus in blood cells. mRNA levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, known to strongly interact with MET, were inversely associated with methylation levels at cg24627299, in an independent cohort of 1180 CD14+ samples. In an open-access dataset of brain tissue, lower methylation at cg24627299 was found in 45 adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder compared with matched controls (padj.<0.05). Furthermore, lower MET expression was identified in the hippocampus of depressed individuals compared with controls in a fourth, independent cohort. Our findings reveal methylation changes at MET in the pathology of depression, possibly involved in downregulation of HGF/c-MET signalling the hippocampal region.",2020,,Epigenetics,15,6-7,646-663,,10.1080/15592294.2019.1700628,,#2251,Ciuculete 2020,"",""
Clinical characteristics including cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in adolescents with psoriasis,"Blegvad, C.; Nybo Andersen, A.-M.; Groot, J.; Zachariae, C.; Barker, J.; Skov, L.","Background: Clinical studies on psoriasis in adolescents have mainly been performed in patients with severe psoriasis. Population-based studies of clinical characteristics and risk factors for later cardiovascular and metabolic disease in children and adolescents are lacking. Objectives: To examine the clinical characteristics of adolescents with psoriasis nested in a general population cohort. Furthermore, to investigate cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in the adolescents with psoriasis compared to parentally predisposed and non-predisposed adolescents without psoriasis from the same birth cohort. Methods: We identified adolescents with and without psoriasis using a nationwide general population birth cohort in Denmark. A clinical examination included skin inspection and scoring of psoriasis severity, completion of a questionnaire on psoriasis and comorbidities, physical measurements, and blood sampling. Participants also completed self-administered questionnaires on quality of life and mental health. Results: We included 81 adolescents with psoriasis and 234 controls (110 with genetic predisposition for psoriasis and 124 without predisposition). Median age was 15.6 (13.5–18.5) years, and in those with active psoriasis, median Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was 1.2 (0.1–11.4). The scalp was the most common site of psoriasis, both at debut and at time of examination. Diaper rash in infancy was more frequent in the psoriasis group. No significant differences regarding quality of life, anxiety and depression were found. More adolescents with psoriasis were obese (8.6% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.008), and physical measures of abdominal obesity were also significantly higher. HbA1c was significantly higher (31.55 vs. 30.81 mmol/mol, P = 0.048), while no differences were found for blood pressure, lipids or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In a subgroup analysis, this was evident in the non-predisposed psoriasis-free controls only. Conclusions: Overall, adolescents with psoriasis from this general population had mild disease.

Deconstructing the neurobiology of cannabis use disorder,"Ferland, J.-M.N.; Hurd, Y.L.","There have been dramatic changes worldwide in the attitudes toward and consumption of recreational and medical cannabis. Cannabinoid receptors, which mediate the actions of cannabis, are abundantly expressed in brain regions known to mediate neural processes underlying reward, cognition, emotional regulation and stress responsivity relevant to addiction vulnerability.

Recent Findings: Despite much research being done in this area, the field of PGX continues to yield controversial findings. In the adult world, studies have focused on the impact of combinatorial gene panels that guide medication selection by providing reports that estimate the impact of multiple pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic genes, but to date, these have not been directly examined in younger patient populations. Pharmacokinetic genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and hypersensitivity genes, HLA-A and HLA-B, have the strongest evidence base for application to pharmacotherapy in children. Summary: Although the field is evolving, and the evidence is mixed, there may be a role for PGX testing in children to help guide dosing and monitoring strategies.

All identified genes are expressed in fetal and adult brain tissue, and some exhibit developmentally regulated expression across the lifespan. We demonstrate genetic overlap with depression, schizophrenia, cognitive functioning, height, body mass index and smoking. Several of the discovered loci are implicated in early brain development and point to involvement of metabolic processes.

Neighborhood Characteristics at Birth and Positive and Negative Psychotic Symptoms in Adolescence: Findings from the ALSPAC Birth Cohort,"Solmi, F.; Lewis, G.; Zammit, S.; Kirkbride, J.B.","Background: Urban birth is associated with risk of non-affective psychoses, but the association with subclinical positive and negative symptoms is less clear, despite emerging evidence. Further the extent to which these findings are confounded by polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia is also unknown. Methods: Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, linked to census geographical indicators, we examined whether various indices of urbanicity at birth were associated with negative and positive psychotic symptoms at age 16 and 18 years, respectively. We used logistic regression models, controlling for child's ethnicity, maternal age, education, marital status, social class, depressive symptoms, other neighborhood exposures, and, in a subsample of children of white ethnicity (N = 10 283), PRS for schizophrenia. Results: Amongst 11 879 adolescents, those born in the most densely populated tertile had greater odds of reporting positive psychotic experiences, after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR]: 1.57, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.14-2.17). Adolescents born in the most socially fragmented neighborhoods had greater odds of negative symptoms, after multivariable adjustment (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06-1.85). Although we found that greater schizophrenia PRS were associated with an increased risk of being born in more deprived and fragmented (bot not more densely populated areas), these associations were not confounded by PRS. Interpretation: Birth into more densely populated and socially fragmented environments increased risk of positive and negative psychotic phenomena in adolescence, respectively, suggesting that different forms of neighborhood social adversity may impinge on different psychopathophysiologies associated with the clinical expression of psychosis.",2020,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,46,3,581-591,,10.1093/schbul/sbz049,,#2280,Solmi 2020,"",For Mahnoor's review?
Monoamine oxidase A genotype and methylation moderate the association of maltreatment and aggressive behaviour,"Checknita, D.; Bendre, M.; Ekström, T.J.; Comasco, E.; Tiihonen, J.; Hodgins, S.; Nilsson, K.W.","Background: The association between childhood maltreatment and subsequent aggressive behaviour is modified by monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) functional polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR) genotype, MAOA-Long (MAOA-L) in females, MAOA-Short (MAOA-S) in males. Childhood maltreatment is associated with differential DNA methylation in several genes. Consistent with recent proposals, we hypothesized that the association of the interaction of MAOA genotype and maltreatment with aggressive behaviour is further moderated by methylation of a region of interest (ROI) spanning the first exon and partial first intron of MAOA. Method: The sample included 117 women and 77 men who completed interviews and questionnaires to report maltreatment and aggressive behaviour towards others and provided saliva samples for DNA extraction. The MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism was genotyped, and methylation of the MAOA ROI was assessed. Results: Following adjustment for substance misuse, psychoactive medication use, and in males tobacco use, the highest levels of aggressive behaviour were found among maltreated male carriers of MAOA-S with high levels of exonic methylation.

Interactions between the combined genotypes of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms and parenting on adolescent depressive symptoms: A three-year longitudinal study,"Wang, M.; Tian, X.; Zhang, W.","Background: The importance of multiple genes-environment interaction (G × E) has been highlighted in studies on depressive symptoms. 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms, with functional interconnection, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. However, little is understood about whether the interaction of 5-HTTLPR, BDNF Val66Met and parenting fits better with the epistatic or cumulative manner. Methods: 865 adolescents (T1: M age = 12.32, 50.2% girls) were included in a three-year interval longitudinal design. Standardized questionares about parenting and depressive symptoms were collected. Saliva samples were collected for genotyping. Results: Neither the concurrent nor longitudinal interaction of 5-HTTLPR, BDNF Val66Met and parenting (G × G × E) showed significant effects on depressive symptoms. The interaction between cumulative genotypes and positive parenting (CG × E) was significant, with the strong differential susceptibility model, for depressive symptoms concurrently but not longitudinally after statistical correction. Adolescents who carried 3 (i.e. SS and Val/Met, L allele and Val/Val) and 4 (i.e. SS and Val/Val), not 1 (i.e. L allele and Met/Met) or 2 cumulative susceptibility alleles (i.e. SS and Met/Met, L allele and Val/Met), reported fewer depressive symptoms if they had experienced higher levels of positive parenting, and more symptoms under lower levels of positive parenting. Limitations: This study did not examine the 5-HTTLPR triallelic (rs25531) marker and did not include an external sample.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of TB-BMD (30–45 years) and smoking were conducted in peripheral blood (PB), whole blood (WB), and adipose tissues. The identified candidate genes were also subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Genetic correlation was only observed between TB-BMD (30–45 years) and cigarette smoking status (P = 0.01, LD score = 0.11 ± 0.04). No significant genetic correlation was detected for other lifestyle/environmental factors, including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, alcohol dependence, and caffeine metabolites for TB-BMD within all of the four age groups. TWAS identified 85 genes in PB and 163 genes in WB for TB-BMD, as well as 123 genes in PB and 257 genes in WB for smoking. Multiple common candidate genes shared by both TB-BMD and smoking were detected, such as MAP1LC3B (PTB-BMD-PB = 1.00 × 10–3, Psmoking-PB = 9.62 × 10–3, PTB-BMD-WB = 2.99 × 10–2) and SLC23A3 (PTB-BMD-WB = 1.48 × 10–2, Psmoking-WB = 8.76 × 10–3).

Predicting risk of suicidal ideation in youth using a multigene panel for impulsive aggression,"Koyama, E.; Zai, C.C.; Bryushkova, L.; Kennedy, J.L.; Beitchman, J.H.","Childhood traumatic experiences and impulsive aggression are strong predictors of suicide ideation in youth. This study examines whether a gene panel previously associated with impulsive aggression, together with a measure of traumatic experience, will predict suicidal ideation in youth. The sample consisted of 158 youth (ages 9–17 years) of European ancestry that participated in a case-control study for childhood aggression. The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI-2) was used to examine suicide ideation and traumatic experiences. The impulsive aggression gene panel consists of 5 markers across 5 susceptibility genes (CRH, CRHR2, MC2R, OXTR, BDNF). A multi-gene risk score (MRS) for each individual was calculated by taking the total number of risk genotypes for that person. The covariates for the multiple regression model included sex, age, symptoms of anxiety/depression, MRS, traumatic experiences, and MRS x traumatic experience interaction. Results show the MRS x traumatic experience interaction term and the anxious/depressed symptoms to be significant predictors of suicide ideation in the full model. Importantly, genetic susceptibility to impulsive aggression and traumatic experiences remained a significant predictor for suicide ideation over and above the youth's level of anxiety and depression.

A Case of Hyperekplexia That Started From Childhood: Clinical Diagnosis With Negative Genetic Investigations,"Antonioni, A.; Peschi, G.; Granieri, E.","Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive, and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis, and even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father's side suffered from the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological, and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50, perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it, therapies were resorted, which, however, produced cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic exam has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in some brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to this condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well-known, which presents symptoms easily mistaken for other more common diseases, because there are no specific clinical-diagnostic tools for the time being. In this particular case, we describe a female patient with an atypical onset age and negative genetic investigations compared with what is known in literature regarding this rare disorder.

Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Persistent Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and in Association With Impulsive and Callous Traits,"Meijer, M.; Klein, M.; Hannon, E.; van der Meer, D.; Hartman, C.; Oosterlaan, J.; Heslenfeld, D.; Hoekstra, P.J.; Buitelaar, J.; Mill, J.; Franke, B.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists into adulthood. ADHD and related personality traits, such as impulsivity and callousness, are caused by genetic and environmental factors and their interplay. Epigenetic modifications of DNA, including methylation, are thought to mediate between such factors and behavior and may behave as biomarkers for disorders. Here, we set out to study DNA methylation in persistent ADHD and related traits. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) on peripheral whole blood from participants in the NeuroIMAGE study (age range 12–23 years). We compared participants with persistent ADHD (n = 35) with healthy controls (n = 19) and with participants with remittent ADHD (n = 19). Additionally, we performed EWASs of impulsive and callous traits derived from the Conners Parent Rating Scale and the Callous-Unemotional Inventory, respectively, across all participants. For every EWAS, the linear regression model analyzed included covariates for age, sex, smoking scores, and surrogate variables reflecting blood cell type composition and genetic background. We observed no epigenome-wide significant differences in single CpG site methylation between participants with persistent ADHD and healthy controls or participants with remittent ADHD. However, epigenome-wide analysis of differentially methylated regions provided significant findings showing that hypermethylated regions in the APOB and LPAR5 genes were associated with ADHD persistence compared to ADHD remittance (p = 1.68 * 10−24 and p = 9.06 * 10−7, respectively); both genes are involved in cholesterol signaling. Both findings appeared to be linked to genetic variation in cis. We found neither significant epigenome-wide single CpG sites nor regions associated with impulsive and callous traits; the top-hits from these analyses were annotated to genes involved in neurotransmitter release and the regulation of the biological clock. No link to genetic variation was observed for these findings, which thus might reflect environmental influences. In conclusion, in this pilot study with a small sample size, we observed several DNA-methylation–disorder/trait associations of potential significance for ADHD and the related behavioral traits.

"The genome-wide risk alleles for psychiatric disorders at 3p21.1 show convergent effects on mRNA expression, cognitive function, and mushroom dendritic spine","Yang, Z.; Zhou, D.; Li, H.; Cai, X.; Liu, W.; Wang, L.; Chang, H.; Li, M.; Xiao, X.","Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BPD) are believed to share clinical features, etiological factors, and disease pathologies (such as impaired cognitive functions and dendritic spine pathology). Meanwhile, there is growing evidence of shared genetic risk between schizophrenia and BPD, despite that our knowledge of the functional risk variations and biological mechanisms is still limited. Here, we conduct summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses through combining the statistical data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both schizophrenia and BPD and multiple expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets of the human brain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues. These integrative investigations identify a lead risk locus at the chromosome 3p21.1 region, which contains numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in varied linkage disequilibrium (LD) and encompasses more than 20 genes. Further analyses suggest that many SNPs at 3p21.1 are significantly associated with both schizophrenia and BPD, and even depression, and the psychiatric risk alleles at 3p21.1 are correlated with mRNA expression of multiple genes such as NEK4, GNL3, and PBRM1. We also identify a 335-bp functional Alu polymorphism rs71052682 in significant LD with the psychiatric GWAS risk SNP rs2251219, and confirm the regulatory effects of this Alu polymorphism on transcription activities. We then explore the involvement of the 3p21.1 locus in the common clinical features and etiology of these illnesses. We reveal that psychiatric risk alleles at 3p21.1 in low-to-high LD consistently predict worse cognitive functions in humans, and manipulating the gene expression (NEK4, GNL3, and PBRM1) linked with higher genetic risk could reduce the density of mushroom dendritic spines in rat primary cortical neurons, mirroring the spine pathology in the prefrontal cortex of psychiatric patients. Our results find that, although the risk alleles at 3p21.1 are in low-to-moderate LD spanning a large genomic area, their underlying biological mechanisms in psychiatric disorders likely converge. These results provide essential insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the chromosome 3p21.1 risk locus in the shared pathological and etiological features of both schizophrenia and BPD.",2020,,Molecular Psychiatry,25,1,48-66,,10.1038/s41380-019-0592-0,,#2301,Yang 2020,"",""
Cognitive functions associated with developing prefrontal cortex during adolescence and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders,"Sakurai, T.; Gamo, N.J.","Cognitive functions including social cognition improve significantly during adolescence, the time period during which the brain typically handles a large volume of incoming information from the outside environment. Processing information and responding to environmental challenges allow the prefrontal cortex, a brain region important for cognition, to mature further and establish self-identity, social skills, and other cognitive abilities, thus helping individuals to function in society. People with vulnerable circuitries predisposed by either genetic or early environmental insults, may not be able to deal with social situations appropriately, and develop network dysfunction that may lead to the onset of schizophrenia, which often occurs during this period. Populations with higher risk for developing schizophrenia present “prodromal” phenotypes, including cognitive deficits, even before the onset of the disorder. Modulating circuit plasticity when the prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable allows us to support the development of cognitive functions in such populations and prevent them from transitioning into full-blown schizophrenia. For this approach to be successful, we need to conduct both human and animal studies side by side to better understand the neurobiology underlying the disorder, especially changes that occur over the disease trajectory that may be clinically relevant.

Rathke's Cleft Cyst Apoplexy in Two Teenage Sisters,"Martinez Santos, J.; Hannay, M.; Olar, A.; Eskandari, R.","Rathke's cleft cysts (RCC) are sellar-suprasellar cysts that are usually discovered incidentally given their indolent clinical course.

We present 2 cases of RCC in sisters who developed a sudden onset of symptoms in a manner similar to pituitary apoplexy. Interestingly, one of them had a very unusual presentation with seizure. We hypothesize that acute symptoms occur due to aggressive intracystic overproduction of mucopolysaccharides (with or without hemorrhage) and a resulting compressive syndrome or local irritation of surrounding structures by spillage of the cyst contents. RCC can be encountered incidentally in family members or may have a familiar predisposition. Since both sisters presented here developed apoplexy symptoms, we propose a more frequent follow-up with sequential imaging in patients with a family history of RCC.

Comparing Within- and Between-Family Polygenic Score Prediction,"Selzam, S.; Ritchie, S.J.; Pingault, J.-B.; Reynolds, C.A.; O'Reilly, P.F.; Plomin, R.","Polygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating, and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality, and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modeling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings: (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement, and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) much of this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a major source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms.

Neurogenetic determinants and mechanisms of addiction to nicotine and smoked tobacco,"Sharp, B.M.; Chen, H.","The single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States is tobacco use. Decades of study show that the risk of becoming addicted to smoked cigarettes varies greatly amongst individuals and is heritable, yet environmental factors are also important contributors. In this review, we consider a wide range of methodologies and key published reports that have defined the inheritance of different stages of nicotine-dependent smoking behavior, including preference, initiation, regular use, withdrawal and dependence as well as cessation and relapse. Major findings from both animal and human studies are discussed. Current findings converge primarily on the role of nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunits, although other neurotransmitter systems as well as nicotine metabolism enzymes are implicated. Various stages of nicotine addiction may share common genetic mechanisms, yet several lines of evidence indicate that each stage also has its own unique genetic determinants. Studies on the heritability of smoking initiation demonstrate substantial evidence for gene–environment interaction, although the precise molecular genetic mechanism(s) remains unknown. Considering the relatively few genes identified so far and the small to modest fraction of the variance in risk for a particular smoking phenotype (e.g., smoking initiation in late adolescence) attributable to these genes, a large gap remains to be filled in order to account for the heritability of key phenotypes involved in each stage of addiction to smoked tobacco.

Furthermore, individuals with 22q are at increased risk for developing psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the impact of bullying on individuals with 22q and the possible impact this has on risk for psychosis in this population.

We reviewed the relationship between bullying and its short and long-term effects on the cognitive, social, and developmental functioning of typically developing individuals and those with special needs. We propose an interactive relationship between trauma, stress, and increased psychosis risk among youth with 22q with a history of bullying.

Results Common variants in MTR, PPARA, ABCC3, CALML5, CACNB2 and PCDHB10 genes were associated with deficits in neurocognitive tests performance, whereas a variant in SLCO1B1 and EPHA5 genes was associated with anxiety and depression. Majority of associations were modulated by intensity of treatment. Associated variants were further analyzed in an independent SJLIFE cohort of 545 ALL survivors. Two variants, rs1805087 in methionine synthase, MTR and rs58225473 in voltage-dependent calcium channel protein encoding gene, CACNB2 are of particular interest, since associations of borderline significance were found in replication cohort and remain significant in combined discovery and replication groups (OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1-2.3; p = 0.04 and; OR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.25-11; p = 0.01, respectively). Variant rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 gene also deserves further attention since previously shown to affect methotrexate clearance and short-term toxicity in ALL patients. Conclusions Current findings can help understanding of the influence of genetic component on long-term neurocognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm whether identified variants may be useful in identifying survivors at increased risk of these complications.",2019,,PLoS ONE,14,6,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0217314,,#2359,Petrykey 2019,"",""
The role of glutamate receptors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: From physiology to disease,"Huang, X.; Wang, M.; Zhang, Q.; Chen, X.; Wu, J.","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents, which is characterized by behavioral problems such as attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. As the receptors of the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), glutamate receptors (GluRs) are strongly linked to normal brain functioning and pathological processes. Extensive investigations have been made about the structure, function, and regulation of GluR family, describing evidences that support the disruption of these mechanisms in mental disorders, including ADHD. In this review, we briefly described the family and function of GluRs in the CNS, and discussed what is recently known about the role of GluRs in ADHD, that including GluR genes, animal models, and the treatment, which would help us further elucidate the etiology of ADHD.",2019,,"American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics",180,4,272-286,,10.1002/ajmg.b.32726,,#2360,Huang 2019,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
Unaffected siblings of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome: Effects on maternal well-being,"Usher, L.V.; DaWalt, L.S.; Greenberg, J.S.; Mailick, M.R.","The present study investigated the effects of children without disabilities on maternal physical and mental health in families with adolescents or adults with fragile X syndrome. Mothers with the FMR1 premutation (N = 87) reported on behavior problems and functional limitations of their adolescent or adult child with fragile X syndrome and their own physical and mental health. Mothers also provided a blood sample to determine FMR1 CGG repeat length. The proportion of unaffected children in the family significantly buffered the effect of both child behavior problems and functional limitations on maternal self-rated health, such that having a higher proportion of unaffected children in the family had a protective effect on maternal health when the target child had more severe behavior problems and functional limitations. There was a similar buffering process for maternal depressive symptoms but at a trend level. Additionally, maternal CGG repeat length had a significant curvilinear association with self-rated health, indicating that mothers with midrange repeat lengths reported the poorest health, whereas mothers with lower and higher repeat lengths in the premutation range reported better health. The data suggest that unaffected children in the family may be an important resource for premutation carrier mothers. Findings are consistent with previous research indicating that mothers with varying levels of genetic liability have variable risk for health problems.

A functional variant in SLC1A3 influences ADHD risk by disrupting a hsa-miR-3171 binding site: A two-stage association study,"Huang, X.; Zhang, Q.; Chen, X.; Gu, X.; Wang, M.; Wu, J.","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with high heritability. Evidence is accumulating that SLC1A3 may play a role in ADHD etiology. Therefore, a two-stage case-control study was conducted on 752 cases and 774 controls to explore the role of SLC1A3 in ADHD. Bioinformatic annotations and functional experiments were applied to reveal the potential biological mechanisms. Finally, SLC1A3 rs1049522 showed significant association with ADHD risk in two stages with CA genotype vs AA genotype, odds ratio (OR) = 0.694 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.570-0.844) and dominant model, OR = 0.749 (95% CI = 0.621-0.904) in the combined stage. Besides, rs1049522 was found to be related to ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptom, and rs1049522-C showed increased SLC1A3 mRNA expression in the cerebellar cortex. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further indicated that rs1049522-C allele enhanced SLC1A3 expression by disrupting the hsa-miR-3171 binding site.

"High genetic risk scores of ASIC2, MACROD2, CHRM3, and C2orf83 genetic variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome impair insulin sensitivity and interact with energy intake in Korean Women","Kim, S.-H.; Liu, M.; Jin, H.S.; Park, S.","Background: We explored the genetic variants that were associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) and evaluated the association of genetic risk scores (GRS) of the selected genetic variants with insulin resistance and the interaction of the GRS with nutrient intake to develop insulin resistance. Methods: The 6 genetic variants involved in brain and nervous system (acid sensing ion channel subunit 2 rs8071961, rs1988598, and rs16589, macro domain containing 2 rs7262810 CHRM3 rs1867265 and chromosome 2 open reading frame 83 rs11889798) were selected from a GWAS of the PCOS study. GRS of the 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated in 3,723 Korean women in the Ansan/Ansung cohort of KARE study. Results: Fasting serum insulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and psychological stress levels were significantly higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group. However, serum-free T4 levels were significantly lower in the high-GRS group. HOMA-IR and CRP were higher OR (1.129 and 1.382) in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group after adjusted for covariates. There was a significant interaction between GRS and daily energy intake (p = 0.004). The OR (1.233) for HOMA-IR was higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group only in the group with lower energy intakes based on estimated energy requirement. Conclusion: Women with high-GRS for PCOS had increased risk of insulin resistance and low energy intake did not protect against the elevation of insulin resistance in women with high GRS.

Methods: 59 healthy controls (HC; 11.19 ± 3.15 yo; 30 girls), 119 children and adolescents with BD (13.31 ± 3.02 yo, 52 girls) and 49 unaffected offspring of BD parents (UO; 9.36 ± 3.18 yo; 22 girls) completed the CANTAB cognitive battery. Results: CGB achieved accuracy of 73.2% and an AUROC of 0.785 in classifying individuals as either BD or non-BD on a dataset held out for validation for testing. The strongest cognitive predictors of BD were measures of processing speed and affective processing. Measures of cognition did not differentiate between UO and HC.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: What do we know so far?,"Coglan, L.; Otasowie, J.","Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was a new diagnosis in DSM-5 and is due to be included in ICD-11. However, confidence in making the diagnosis seems to be low among clinicians.

However, this first study on genetic variants of the NPY-system could not confirm the association between the investigated SNPs and eoOCD. Based on the small sample size results have to be interpreted as preliminary and should be replicated in larger samples.

"Chronic stress exposure, diurnal cortisol slope, and implications for mood and fatigue: Moderation by multilocus HPA-Axis genetic variation","Starr, L.R.; Dienes, K.; Li, Y.I.; Shaw, Z.A.","Chronic stress exposure has been shown to alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, which may mediate its effects on psychopathology and negative health outcomes. The nature of the chronic stress-HPA axis dysregulation is unclear and individuals likely vary in the extent to and manner in which indices of HPA axis regulation, such as diurnal cortisol slope, are influenced by chronic stress. We examined whether HPA-axis-linked genetic variation moderates the association between chronic stress and diurnal cortisol slope, and potential implications for mood and fatigue (possible manifestations of negative clinical outcomes). 211 adolescents (M age 15.89, 54.5% female) completed chronic stress interviews and provided DNA samples. Participants then provided saliva samples at waking and 12 h post-waking for two consecutive weekdays. HPA-axis genetic variation was calculated using a multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) approach, using ten SNPs from CRHR1, NR3C1, NR3C2, and FKBP5 to generate an additive score of HPA-axis-linked genetic risk. Neither chronic stress nor MGPS directly predicted diurnal slope, but MGPS moderated the association between chronic stress and diurnal slope, with stress predicting a high waking cortisol followed by steep slope among youth with low but not high MGPS scores. MGPS also interacted with chronic stress to predict both negative affect and fatigue, and moderated the indirect effect of chronic stress on mood and fatigue via diurnal slope. Results suggest that diurnal cortisol regulation may be one mechanism by which genetic risk intensifies the association between chronic stress and negative outcomes.",2019,,Psychoneuroendocrinology,100,"(Starr L.R., lisa.starr@rochester.edu; Li Y.I.; Shaw Z.A.)

Headache and migraine,"Pascual, J.","Headache is the most frequent reason for neurological consultation. Headaches can be divided into primary (no substrate can be demonstrated) and secondary. Primary headaches account for most of the consultations, with migraine as the most frequent and discapacitating. The precise etiology of the current forms of migraine is unknown, though genetic predisposition and ambient precipitants are involved. In contrast, migraine pathophysiology is rather well-known. While the generation of the attacks is central, hypothalamic, pain itself is due to the leptomeningeal release of neuropeptides, mainly CGRP, as a consequence of the activation of the trigemino-vascular system. The aura is secondary to a cortical spreading depression phenomenon. Migraine diagnosis is based in clinical criteria and normal examination. Migraine begins in childhood/adolescence, with attacks of moderate-severe, pulsating, hemicranial pain lasting 4–72 hours and with intolerance to light, sound and any movement. About one-third of migraine patients experience aura, usually containing positive visual symptoms or paraesthesias. Its management comprises always general measures and symptomatic medications (NSAIDs and/or triptans) and preventatives if there are more than 3 attacks per month, with beta-blockers and topiramate as first choices.

Recently, epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation have emerged as potential mechanisms that could mediate this relationship. The authors conducted a genome-wide methylation analysis to investigate whether differentially methylated regions are associated with psychosocial stress in an adolescent population. Methods: A methylome-wide analysis of differentially methylated regions was used to examine a sample of 1,287 14-year-old adolescents (50.7% of them female) from the European IMAGEN study. The Illumina 450k array was used to assess DNA methylation, pyrosequencing was used for technical replication, and linear regression analyses were used to identify associations with psychosocial stress and substance use (alcohol and tobacco). Findings were replicated by pyrosequencing a test sample of 413 participants from the IMAGEN study. Results: Hypermethylation in the sterile alpha motif/pointed domain containing the ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) gene locus was associated with a greater number of stressful life events in an allele-dependent way. Among individuals with the minor G-allele, SPDEF methylation moderated the association between psychosocial stress and substance abuse. SPDEF methylation interacted with lifetime stress in gray matter volume in the right cuneus, which in turn was associated with the frequency of alcohol and tobacco use. SPDEF was involved in the regulation of trans-genes linked to substance use.

Animal studies, however, show that under specific postnatal conditions prenatal stress may have other, less detrimental consequences for the offspring. Here, we studied mental health and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in saliva following intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy in São Gonçalo, a Brazilian city with high levels of violence. Not surprisingly, mothers exposed to pregnancy IPV expressed elevated depression, PTSD and anxiety symptoms. Children had similar psychiatric problems when they experienced maternal IPV after being born. More surprisingly, when maternal IPV occurred both during (prenatal) and after pregnancy these problems were absent. Following prenatal IPV, genomic sites in genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and its repressor FKBP51 (FKBP5) were among the most differentially methylated and indicated an enhanced ability to terminate hormonal stress responses in prenatally stressed children. These children also showed more DNA methylation in heterochromatin-like regions, which previously has been associated with stress/disease resilience. A similar relationship was seen in prenatally stressed middle-eastern refugees of the same age as the Sao Goncalo children but exposed to postnatal war-related violence. While our study is limited in location and sample size, it provides novel insights on how prenatal stress may epigenetically shape resilience in humans, possibly through interactions with the postnatal environment.

Yet, it is currently unclear whether: (a) DNAm patterns in humans associate with physical aggression independently of other co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral symptoms; (b) whether these patterns are observable across multiple tissues; and (c) whether they may function as a causal versus noncausal biomarker of physical aggression. Here, we used a multisample, cross-tissue design to address these questions. First, we examined genome-wide DNAm patterns (buccal swabs; Illumina 450k) associated with engagement in physical fights in a sample of high-risk youth (n = 119; age = 16–24 years; 53% female). We identified one differentially methylated region in DRD4, which survived genome-wide correction, associated with physical aggression above and beyond co-occurring symptomatology (e.g., ADHD, substance use), and showed strong cross-tissue concordance with both blood and brain. Second, we found that DNAm sites within this region were also differentially methylated in an independent sample of young adults, between individuals with a history of chronic-high versus low physical aggression (peripheral T cells; ages 26–28). Finally, we ran a Mendelian randomization analysis using GWAS data from the EAGLE consortium to test for a causal association of DRD4 methylation with physical aggression. Only one genetic instrument was eligible for the analysis, and results provided no evidence for a causal association. Overall, our findings lend support for peripheral DRD4 methylation as a potential biomarker of physically aggressive behavior, with no evidence yet of a causal relationship.",2018,,"American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics",177,8,746-764,,10.1002/ajmg.b.32689,,#2402,Cecil 2018,"",""

Optimal long-term care requires that risks to vulnerable organs are clearly defined and translated into guidelines that are implemented into practice. PanCareLIFE is a pan-European consortium that addresses survivorship issues comprising fertility, hearing impairment and quality of life. This article describes the scientific basis of PanCareLIFE's studies. Methods: PanCareLIFE involves 17 partner institutions from eight European countries, with additional 11 data providers from five other countries. Study designs and methods include molecular genetic, cohort and case-control studies, a longitudinal study and an intervention study. Ethics and data protection issues have been taken into account from the beginning. Results: PanCareLIFE will investigate the way that treatment impairs female fertility, by evaluating anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the underlying genetic susceptibility to loss of fertility. For our fertility studies, more than 6000 survivors have completed questionnaires, more than 1500 provided serum samples and more than 400 case-control triads have been identified. Fertility preservation guidelines for boys and girls will be developed. More than 2000 survivors have contributed audiograms for the ototoxicity study. Almost 1000 samples were sent for genetic analysis related to ototoxicity and gonadal reserve. The SF-36 questionnaire will measure quality of life in more than 10,000 survivors. Conclusions: The large number of subjects enrolled in PanCareLIFE and the detailed information accumulated will allow in-depth evaluation of important outcomes.

A Randomized Trial of a Web-based Non-pharmacological Pain Intervention for Pediatric Chronic Pancreatitis,"","Brief SummaryAbdominal pain is common in children with chronic and acute recurring pancreatitis (CP, ARP), and as they continue into adulthood, the disease progresses with increased pain and greater exposure to opioids. Despite the relevancy of early pain self-management for childhood pancreatitis, there have been no studies of non-pharmacological pain intervention in this population. The proposed project will evaluate a web-based cognitive behavioral pain management program delivered to a cohort of well-phenotyped children with CP/ARP and some community participants to reduce pain, pain-related disability and enhance HRQOL; it will also identify genetic risk factors and clinical and behavioral phenotypic factors associated with treatment response to enable precision medicine approaches.Detailed DescriptionAbdominal pain is present in 81% of children and adolescents with CP and ARP. Effective treatments that target pain in these children will lessen the risk of opioid exposure and continued pain and disability into adulthood. We plan to recruit a large multicenter sample of 260 children and adolescents (ages 10-19 years) with CP/ARP and their parents from INSPPIRE 2 (INSPPIRE:INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) centers and pancreatitis community groups (e.g. NPF) to evaluate the efficacy of WebMAP, a web-based cognitive behavioral pain management program (CBT). The study design is a two (group) x three (time point) randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive online access to either pain education (WebED) or CBT (WebMAP) over an 8-10 week treatment period. The primary study outcome is abdominal pain symptoms measured at pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include pain-related disability, health-related quality of life, depression and anxiety symptoms, and medication use. This project represents a significant advance in pain management for children with CP/ARP by evaluating the first ever nonpharmacologic pain intervention in these patients, which may guide future developments in the management of chronic pain associated with CP/ARP.",2018,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2414,,"",""
The “concept-reality mismatch” in the globalization era as a psychosocial stressor contributing to the occurrence of mental disorders,"Bou Khalil, R.","Aims: The “concept-reality mismatch” in the globalization era is a novel conceptualization of psychosocial stress due to difficulties in experiencing five of the most important positive emotions for psychological well-being. These emotions are love, trust, faith, pleasure and self-esteem. Methods: a narrative overview of the literature using the terms “positive emotions,” “positive psychology,” “globalization” and “self-discrepancy” has been done. Selected articles are those considered to support the basic ideas mentioned in this hypothesis. Results: Differences in how adolescents and young adults experience positive emotions in real life in relation to their conceptual background exist. Authentic love described in books and movies might become perceived as more difficult to find. Trust, in the era of long distance relationships, is being built based on different criteria than those adolescents and young adults are taught to apply. Faith is challenged by the facility of accessing scientific data and by the lack of parental positive influence towards religiosity. Pleasure is being claimed as a right to cope with stress even artificially. Self-esteem is becoming more and more restricted to wealth, beauty and fame as promoted by modern communication technologies. Conclusions: The “concept-reality mismatch” may be considered as an essential and preventable psychosocial stressor contributing to the development of mental and substance use disorders in the modern world.

Research object 2.1 General characteristics of the research object Based on the refraction development archive system that has been constructed in Shanghai, the list of children and adolescents with high myopia was selected from the database of children's refractive development archives information in Shanghai. Children of different ages with high myopia must meet the following conditions: 1. 4-5 years old, equivalent spherical error(SE) ≤ -4.0 diopter(D）; 2. 6-8 years old, equivalent spherical error(SE) ≤ -6.0 diopter(D）; 3. 9-18 years old, equivalent spherical error(SE) ≤ -8.0 diopter(D）. 2.2 Sample size A total of 1.25 million children and adolescents are currently registered, 4,006 (0.32%) of which meet the entry requirements. Among the 4\~5 year olds, there are 815 people with SE≤-4D; 842 people with SE≤-6 D among the 6\~8 year olds; 2349 people with SE≤-8D among the people aged 9 and over . Taking into account the 50% non-response and the proportion of the exclusion, the initial registration number is about 2,000. 2.3 Source of study object Children and adolescents who meet the inclusion criteria in the Shanghai Children's Refractive Development Archives Information Database System.Detailed Description1. introduction 1.1 Overview of myopia and high myopia Myopia is the most common eye disease in the world . Among them, the incidence and prevalence of myopia are highest in developed countries and regions in East and Southeast Asia. It is predicted that by 2050, global myopia patients would reach 5 billion, 1 billion of which were high myopia. In developed countries and regions in East and Southeast Asia, the prevalence of myopia in high school graduates is as high as 80% to 90%. A study in Taiwan showed that more than 80% of adolescents suffered from myopia when they graduated from high school, 10% of whom were high myopia. Another study which focused on university students in Shanghai showed that 95.5% of college students suffered from myopia, and 19.5% of them were high myopia. In stark contrast, the prevalence of myopia in the same age in western developed countries is between 20% and 40%. In less developed countries and regions of the world, the incidence of myopia in young people is about 5% to 10% due to the low level of education. At present, the etiology and pathogenesis of myopia and high myopia are still unclear. Environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of myopia and high myopia. Among them, the level of education and outdoor activity time are closely related to the development of myopia and high myopia. At present, most studies believe that the higher the education level, the higher the incidence of myopia and the deeper the degree of myopia. In addition, most studies suggest that outdoor activities was a protective factor for myopia, and increasing outdoor activity time could reduce the incidence of myopia. Also, some studies have shown that the age of onset of myopia was closely related to high myopia. Furthermore, genes may also be closely related to the occurrence of myopia and high myopia. At least 19 myopic loci have been identified through family studies and twin studies till now. With the completion of the Human Genome Project, genome-wide association analysis technology is becoming more and more mature, and more and more related genes and mutation sites have been elucidated, but the pathogenic genes of myopia are still not completely clear. In addition, the genes related to pathological myopia and fundus lesions are currently unclear. In recent studies, high myopia and pathological myopia are not strictly differentiated (pathological myopia is defined by diopter or axial length alone). Therefore, genes related to pathological myopia need further research, in order to judge whether high myopia and pathological myopia are two different diseases at genetic level or different states controlled by the same genes. 1.2 Relationship between high myopia and pathological myopia The fundus of patients with high myopia is often accompanied by a series of pathological changes, such as posterior scleral staphyloma, retinal choroidal atrophy, lacquer crack, choroidal neovascularization（CNV）, macular hemorrhage, Fuchs plaque, retinal palpebral fissure, retinal tear, retinal detachment. These pathological changes are important causes of decreased vision and even blindness. Some studies have shown that macular degeneration caused by myopia has become a major cause of blindness and low vision. In Jing'an District of Shanghai, high myopia with macular degeneration has leapt to the first place in adult blindness. A study in Beijing showed that pathological myopia has become the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the 40-49 age group. Although high myopia is closely related to pathological myopia, and most patients with pathological myopia are highly myopic, high myopia is not equivalent to pathological myopia. The change of diopter and axial length do not fully reflect the characteristics of pathological myopia. Some patients with high myopia have no definite fundus lesions, and some non-high myopia patients may also have posterior scleral staphyloma, retinochoroid atrophy and other complications. At present, Ohno-Matsui K et al define pathological myopia as: myopic macular degeneration ≥ 2 (diffuse retinochoroid atrophy), or additional lesions (lacquer cracks, choroidal neovascularization, Fuchs plaque), or posterior scleral staphyloma. In this definition of pathological myopia, we focus on fundus lesions caused by myopia, and do not emphasize diopter and axial length. At present, there are still many unknowns about the relationship between high myopia and pathological myopia. The process of developing simple high myopia in children and adolescents as pathological myopia is still unclear. Does high myopia eventually evolve into pathological myopia? Are pathological myopia and high myopia different stages of the same disease or two different diseases? Which fundus changes can predict the occurrence of pathological myopia? These problems need further exploration. 1.3 Morphology and visual function changes in fundus of children with high myopia At present, there are few studies on the changes of fundus morphology and visual function in children with high myopia. And long-term follow-up studies are also lacking. Morphological studies suggest that the common fundus changes in children with high myopia include β-peripapillary atrophy（β-PPA）, optic disc tilt, etc., but the incidence of posterior scleral staphyloma and retinochoroid atrophy is low in childhood. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that diffuse retinochoroid atrophy around the optic disc in childhood could easily develop into pathological myopia in adulthood. In addition, thinning of the retina, choroid, and sclera is also present in children with myopia and high myopia. In addition to the fundus of the posterior pole, there are also multiple lesions in the peripheral fundus. Some studies considered that peripheral fundus lesions such as lattice-like degeneration, non-compressive whitening, and retinal tears are more common in children with high myopia. Corresponding to structural changes, there are also changes in micro-field and electrophysiology of patients with high myopia. However, there is few studies focusing on children and adolescents with high myopia, and no long-term follow-up studies has been reported. There are still many unknowns in the early morphological changes, evolution process and visual function of high myopia, which deserve further exploration. 1.4 The direction of this research A． Follow-up study of morphological changes in the fundus of children with high myopia; B． Follow-up study of visual function changes in children with high myopia; C． Etiological studies related to high myopia in children; D． Follow-up study of quality of life, psychology, behavior, and social interactions in children with high myopia. 2. Data collection 2.1 Preparatory work A． Establish Shanghai Children and Adolescents High Myopia Registration Information System and Workflow: a set of information function modules including appointment, real-time collection of exam data, online feedback of exam results, daily consultation contact and data management analysis. And then establish the workflow SOP file; B． Train physicians, optometrists and other relevant staff responsible for the research; C． Print promotional materials, questionnaires, informed consent forms and examination flow charts; D． Contact the children and adolescents in the Shanghai Children's Refractive Development Archives Information Database System through their school and use science lectures, WeChat（a kind of APP） official accounts, Weibo(Chinese version of Twitter), paper leaflets to promote the harm of high and pathological myopia to children, adolescents and their parents, as well as introduction of the content of this study, the participants' benefits and potential risks; E． Sign an informed consent form to collect information on the participants; F． The appointment is registered through the information system. 2.2 Examination process The brief process is as follows: Identity information registration \> height, weight \> naked eye vision \& wearing vision \> axial length \> intraocular pressure \> slit lamp anterior segment examination \> Microperimetry (selected) \> cycloplegia \> Autorefraction and subjective refraction \> Pentacam, Swept-source optical coherence tomography（SS-OCT，Topcon), wide-angle optical coherence tomography angiography(OCTA,Zeiss-9000), fundus color photography + autofluorescence(Topcon), Ultra wide Angle fundus photography(Optos), mfERG (optional), wavefront aberrations \> blood sample collection / saliva specimens \> fill out the questionnaire. The specific flow chart is as follows. 2.3 Ophthalmology inspection project operation rules 2.3.1 Vision test The eyesight examination used the ETDRS visual acuity chart (LCD backlit lamp, WH0701), the test distance was 4 meters, and the visual target at 20/20 was the same height as the eye of the examinee. The recognition time of each visual target is 2\~3s; the eye of the subject is required to be opened normally for examination, and the blinking, hoeing, neck stretching and peeking are strictly prevented. Vision is converted to a decimal count record. Visual acuity examination includes two parts: uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and corrected visual acuity (CVA). Children who are not wearing glasses are only examined by UCVA, and children who wear glasses are required to check CVA after completing the UCVA test. 2.3.2 Axis measurement The axial measurement was performed using an IOL Master (version 5.02, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Simulated eye calibration was needed before measurement. Each eye was measured repeatedly for 3 times, and the difference was less than 0.02 mm each time. For those who still have large fluctuations in multiple measurements, the examiner needs to record it. 2.3.3 Intraocular pressure measurement Intraocular pressure was measured using a non-contact tonometer (NT-4000, Nidek, USA). Each eye was repeatedly measured 3 times and averaged, and the difference between each two was less than 5 mmHg. Those with an intraocular pressure higher than 24 mmHg should be recorded and added for visual field examination. 2.3.4 Ophthalmologist examination Ophthalmologist examinations included anterior segment slit lamp examination (66 Vision. Tech, Suzhou,China) and ophthalmoscopy examination(66 Vision. Tech, Suzhou,China). The examination of the anterior segment slit lamp includes the eyelid, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil, lens and anterior vitreous body, which is completed by the investigator's senior ophthalmologist. For patients with peripheral anterior chamber depth less than 1/2 corneal thickness, or acute inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye and other related diseases, it is not suitable for cycloplegia afterwards. It should be registered by the examining physician and suspended or excluded from the study. In addition, the ophthalmologist should use corneal reflection, occlusion-de-covering, etc. to determine whether the subject has strabismus (hidden strabismus or strabismus). Those who were strabismus should be excluded from the study. For those suspected of having fundus diseases, ophthalmoscopy (direct ophthalmoscope or 90D) can be performed after cycloplegia, and the nature of fundus disease is judged by an ophthalmologist. Participants with myopia-related fundus lesions can be registered and included in the study, while participants with other fundus lesions need to be excluded after recorded. Those who had other organic eye diseases were also excluded after recording. 2.3.5 Microperimetry Microperimetry examinations were performed in the darkroom and needed to be performed prior to OCT and fundus photographic examinations to avoid influence by bright light. Microperimetry was performed using an MP1 micro-perimeter (MP-1, Nidek, Japan), and the Goldman III, 4-2-1 mode was selected to detect retinal light sensitivity within 10 degrees of the macula. There were a total of 40 stimulation points (1°-8 stimulation points, 3°-16 stimulation points, 5°-16 stimulation points), and the stimulation intensity of each point is from 20 decibels (dB) (equivalent to 20 asb) to 0 dB ( Equivalent to 400 asb) change. Initial stimulation intensity is 16 dB and stimulation duration is 100 ms. The background light is white, 4asb. All participants will receive at least 5 light stimuli before the formal test, making them familiar with the examination process and minimizing the impact of learning effects. The test procedure is as follows: the infrared fundus camera takes a fundus shot (45° field of view) and transmits it to the video monitor. The fixation target and the stimulation point are projected onto the retina by the liquid crystal display. The eyeball automatic tracking system tracks the position of the retina in real time to ensure each stimulation point in the predetermined retinal position. Every 60 s system will project a super-threshold stimulus on the physiological blind spot to monitor the false positive reaction. If a false positive reaction occurs, it needs to be re-examined. This item is optional for children under 10 years old. 2.3.6 Cycloplegia The cycloplegia procedure is as follows: 1 drop of 0.5% proparacaine (Alcaine, Alcon) is added to the conjunctival sac of each eye, and 2 drops of 1% cyclopentolate are added to each eye after 15 seconds. (Cyclogyl, Alcon), 5 minutes apart. After each drip, ask the participant to press the inner canthus for a few seconds gently and try to take the head back posture. The last drop of cyclopentolate was instilled into the conjunctival sac for 30 minutes to check for light reflection. If the light reflection disappeared and the pupil diameter was greater than 6 mm, cycloplegia was considered complete. If the light reflection still exists, add a third drop of cyclopentolate, and re-examine the light reflection and pupil diameter after 20 minutes. If there was still light reflection, the inspector needs to record this. During cycloplegia, if the participant has symptoms of ocular discomfort, the ophthalmologist should carefully examine it and give an appropriate treatment. 2.3.7 Measurement of refractive state and corneal radius of curvature (CR) The refractive status and CR measurements were performed using an automated computer refractometer (KR-8900, Topcon, Japan), which was performed after ciliary muscle paralysis. Simulated eye calibration needed before measurement. Each eye was repeatedly measured three times to average, and if any two results differ by more than 0.5 D, the measurement needed to be repeated. If there were still significant differences in the results of multiple measurements, the examiner needed to record it. 2.3.8 Subjective optometry Children who do not wear glasses have a UCVA of less than 0.8 (less than 0.63 for children 6 years of age and younger) or children with glasses have a CVA of less than 0.8 (children under 6 years of age and below 0.63) need to finish a subjective optometry after cycloplegia in order to measure the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). If the BCVA is less than 0.8 (less than 0.63 for children aged 6 and under), or the degree of compliance during the examination is poor, the examiner should record it. If the BCVA is less than 0.8 (children under 6 years of age and below is less than 0.63), further examination by an ophthalmologist is required to determine whether the inclusion conditions are still met. 2.3.9 Pentacam Pentacam (OCULUS Optikgeratic Gmbh, Germany) was examined after cycloplegia. Measurements include corneal diameter and curvature, anterior chamber depth and volume, anterior chamber angle, pupil diameter, crystal thickness, etc. Shooting requirements: Image quality display ""OK"", crystal thickness value is available. This item is optional for children under 6 years old. 2.3.10 SS-OCT （Topcon） SS-OCT (DRI OCT Triton, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) was examined after cycloplegia. OCT location: Macular + optic disc area. Shooting mode: 12\*9 mm 3D scan mode (4 overlap) / Line scan (64 overlap) + 9 mm radial scan mode (16 overlap, follow up mode) + optic disc area 9 Mm radial scan mode (16 overlap, follow up mode) + macular area 7\*7 mm 3D scan mode (4 overlap) + optic disc area 6\*6 mm 3D scan mode (4 overlap). Shooting requirements: input spherical error, cylinder, axis length, corneal curvature radius correction magnification before shooting; image signal of strength 3D scan mode is not less than 50, radial scan mode is not lower than 60, peripheral image avoids mirror flip as much as possible. When shooting the disc area, we need to manually adjust the shooting center to the center of the disc. If the image quality is affected by blinking or eye movement during shooting, you need to re-shoot. If you still can't meet the requirements, you need to record it. SS-OCT comes with a fundus color photograph. The shooting position is required to be consistent with the SS-OCT scanning position and to avoid eyelids, eyelashes and hair occlusion. Dark areas are avoided in the image, and the image quality is not less than 90. This item is optional for children under 6 years old. 4.3.11 Wide angle OCT/OCTA (Zeiss-9000) Wide-angle OCT/OCTA examinations were performed after cycloplegia.OCT/OCTA location：macular + optic disc area. Shooting mode: 12\*12mm, 15\*9mm angio mode; 16mm loop sweep mode (horizontal and vertical directions) a total of 8 scans. Shooting requirements: communicate more with the subject;the forehead and chin must be close to the instrument.If the image quality is affected by blinking or eye movement during shooting, you need to re-shoot.This item is optional for children under 6 years old. 2.3.12 Fundus photography + autofluorescence Fundus photography + autofluorescence was performed after cycloplegia.Shooting content: pseudo color eye fundus + spontaneous fluorescent fundus.Shooting requirements: The exposure intensity is 30ws and 300ws respectively and it needs to focus on the split line and rotate the upper refractive compensation button. If you find the participant not completely cycloplegic, please take another drop of cyclopentolate , otherwise there will be a dark area. This item is recommended for final inspection as the exposure is too bright. 2.3.13 Ultra wide-angle fundus photography (Optos) Optos ultra-wide-angle fundus photography was performed after cycloplegia. Shooting content: pseudo color eye fundus + spontaneous fluorescent fundus. Shooting requirements: the same as color fundus photography. 2.3.14 mfERG mfERG (RETIscan, 3.15 version, Roland, Germany) was examined after cycloplegia. After 0.5% topical anesthesia with procaine hydrochloride, the contact lens was placed on the cornea, the ground electrode was placed in the middle of the forehead, and the reference electrode was placed on the lateral iliac crest to correct refractive error. The stimulator has an average brightness of 102 cd/m 2 (4\~200 cd/m 2), a contrast ratio of 99%, and stimulates the retina with a center of about 30° around the macula. There are 61 hexagons, each of which is six. The edge is flipped in black and white under the control of the binary m sequence. Each stimulation cycle time is 47 s, stimulating 6 cycles. This item is optional for children under 10 years old. 2.3.15 Wavefront aberration When the corneal topography and wavefront aberrations are measured, the subject's eyes are enlarged, and the operator or assistant pulls the upper eyelid if necessary. 2.4 Collection of blood/saliva specimens 5 ml of Blood/saliva specimens were collected. Blood/saliva specimens are temporarily stored in a portable refrigerator on site and transferred to a -80 °C deep-temperature refrigerator as soon as possible. The detection of serum riboflavin and related cytokine levels will be carried out in the Ophthalmology Laboratory of the Shanghai General Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 2.5 Questionnaire The questionnaire is divided into 5 parts: A． General information, including birth status (maternal pregnancy status, premature birth history, feeding status, etc.), family status (family history of myopia, family economic status, parental education level, parental physical condition, etc.), growth and development status, living and learning status (living environment , dietary status, sleep status, academic burden, academic performance, etc.), past medical history (including systemic and eye diseases); B． Quality of life for children with high myopia (NEI-VFQ-25 scale); C． High myopia children's psychology (NEI-VFQ-25 scale, depression self-assessment(SDS), anxiety self-assessment table(SAS), self-esteem scale(SES)); D． High myopia child behavior (NEI-VFQ-25 scale); E． Social interaction for children with high myopia (NEI-VFQ-25 scale). The questionnaire is completed by the parent or guardian. Children and adolescents aged 10 or older are required to complete additional questionnaires to conduct self-evaluation on quality of life, psychology, behavior and social interaction. The questionnaires are mainly filled in online. For parents or children who are not convenient to fill out the questionnaire online, a paper-based questionnaire can be issued and collected after completion. 3.

The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau are responsible for the coordination of major issues. B. Shanghai third-level eye disease prevention and control system (city-district (county)-community) jointly guarantees the implementation of research C. The Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center is the only municipal-level eye disease prevention and control institution in Shanghai. It leads the city's 16 districts and counties and more than 240 community-level eye care institutions to jointly develop eye care services. D. The Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center can provide sufficient human resources for the research. Most of the inspection teams are staff members of the hospital and have extensive clinical experience. In addition, the Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center has extensive experience in recruiting temporary volunteers. 3.3 Quality control and supervision A． All participants in the study are required to be trained before the study is officially launched. The training content is printed as a work manual and distributed to researchers. The clinician, optometrist or technician who participates in the examination needs to learn the corresponding part of the work requirements, procedures, instrument use and operation specifications before going to work. After the passing examination, the official examination can be carried out. For items that are responsible by multiple people, it is necessary to complete the consistency test before the study is officially carried out to ensure that the results between different examiners are comparable. B． All inspectors are only able to know the relevant parameters necessary for the inspection items they are responsible for, and remain blind for other irrelevant parameters. C． The instrument should be calibrated before the start of the work on each inspection day. D． Researchers responsible for quality control should regularly check the inspection data of each inspection post. The quality control standards refer to the operating rules on the work manual. For those who have higher failure rate, they need to re-train and pass the examination before they can re-employ. E． Follow-up content and criteria were consistent with baseline. The equipment for follow-up examination is as close as possible to the baseline, and the examiner is as consistent as possible. If inspection instrument must be replaced due to the upgrade, the comparability of the old and new instruments should be evaluated. F． The follow-up interval was as consistent as possible. G． The reliability and validity of the questionnaire needs to be assessed before use. 3.4 Data entry, analysis and deletion A． The online data system is researched and developed by professional information technology companies, used to check real-time data entry, questionnaire filling, etc. The accuracy and completeness of the data is automatically determined by the data system. B． The entry of non-electronic data is done independently by two people. C． Data deletion and analysis were performed independently by two statisticians. 4. Statistical Analysis 4.1 Descriptive statistics A． Continuity variables: sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartile B． Classification variable or grade variable: frequency distribution 4.2 statistical methods A. Continuous variables: The normality test uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the normal distribution is satisfied, the t test or one-way ANOVA is used; if the normal distribution is not satisfied, the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal Wallis test is used. The two-two comparison between groups was performed using the Bonferroni method. B. Categorical variable: chi-square test. C. Correlation analysis: simple linear regression and stepwise multiple linear regression, using nonlinear regression if necessary. 4.3 Statistical significance All differences were statistically defined as P \< 0.05 (bilateral) 4.4 Subgroup analysis Subjects will be assigned to different subgroups for subgroup analysis based on age, gender, diopter, axial length, fundus structure, and functional changes. 4.5 Interim analysis Baseline data (2018) and follow-up data for every 3 years are used for analysis and reporting. 5. Ethical issues 5.1 Ethics committee The study will be carried out after the approval of the Shanghai General Hospital Ethics Committee and strictly abide by the Helsinki Declaration. 5.2 Protect the privacy of participants In order to protect the privacy of the children and adolescents in the test, when the research materials are provided to other organizations, the subject code or initials should be used instead of their ID number or real name. In addition, the researcher and the relevant staff involved in the research must keep the privacy information of the children and adolescents in the test confidential. 5.3 Informed consent The informed consent form will be distributed to the children and adolescents participating in the study and their parents or guardians after approval by the ethics committee. For children and adolescents and their parents or guardians who voluntarily agree to participate in the study, parents or guardians are required to sign an informed consent form prior to the baseline study. Before signing the informed consent form, the researcher should fully introduce the content of the study, the benefit of the subject and the potential risks, and confirm that the children and adolescents and their parents or guardians fully understand and voluntarily sign the informed consent form. When signing the informed consent form, the parent or guardian has sufficient time to consider and has the right to ask questions. For questions from parents or guardians, the researcher needs to provide adequate answers. For parents or guardians who agree to sign an informed consent form, the investigator signs the informed consent form after the informed consent is fully explained and states the relationship with the child and adolescent. Informed consent is in duplicate, one of which is kept by the parent or guardian and the other is kept by the researcher. During the research process, if there is a major change in the research content, the revised informed consent form should be sent to the ethics committee for approval. After the approval, the researcher must fully communicate with the children and adolescents and their parents or guardians, and confirm that they agree to continue to participate in the study and re-sign the informed consent form. 6.

Frequent aetiologies are gallstones and alcohol abuse. In contrast to chronic pancreatitis (CP) few robust genetic associations have been described. Here we analysed whether common variants in the CLDN2-MORC4 and the PRSS1-PRSS2 locus that increase recurrent AP and CP risk associate with AP. Methods: We screened 1462 AP patients and 3999 controls with melting curve analysis for SNPs rs10273639 (PRSS1-PRSS2), rs7057398 (RIPPLY), and rs12688220 (MORC4). Calculations were performed for the overall group, aetiology, and gender sub-groups. To examine genotype-phenotype relationships we performed several meta-analyses. Results: Meta-analyses of all AP patients depicted significant (p-value < 0.05) associations for rs10273639 (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.97, p-value 0.01), rs7057398 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07–1.5, p-value 0.005), and rs12688220 (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12–1.56, p-value 0.001).

Genetic insights into ADHD biology,"Hayman, V.; Fernandez, T.V.","ADHD is a neurobiological disorder with a large worldwide prevalence causing significant impairment in children, adolescents, and adults. While there is general agreement about genetic contributions toward the disorder, progress in leveraging genetics to learn more about the biology and risk factors for ADHD has been limited. In this perspective, we identified 105 genes from the literature showing at least nominal statistical significance in association with ADHD. We analyzed these genes for enrichment in biological pathways and in known interacting biological networks. We also analyzed the expression patterns of candidate genes across brain regions and across periods of human development. From our analysis, we identify 14 genes that cluster within an interactive gene network, with enrichment in nitric oxide synthase and alpha-1 adrenergic pathways. Furthermore, these genes show enrichment for expression in the cerebellum during childhood through young adulthood, and in the cortex in adolescence and young adulthood. Gene discovery holds great potential for elucidating the unknown biological underpinnings of ADHD. Genome-wide sequencing efforts are underway and are likely to provide important insights that can be leveraged for new treatments and interventions.",2018,,Frontiers in Psychiatry,9,JUN,,,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00251,,#2435,Hayman 2018,"",""
Individual biological sensitivity to environmental influences: testing the differential susceptibility properties of the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in relation to depressive symptoms and delinquency in two adolescent general samples,"Åslund, C.; Nilsson, K.W.","The gene–environment interaction research field in psychiatry has traditionally been dominated by the diathesis–stress framework, where certain genotypes are assumed to confer increased risk for adverse outcomes in a stressful environment. In later years, theories of differential susceptibility, or biological sensitivity, suggest that candidate genes that interact with environmental events do not exclusively confer a risk for behavioural or psychiatric disorders but rather seem to alter the sensitivity to both positive and negative environmental influences. The present study investigates the susceptibility properties of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) in relation to depressive symptoms and delinquency in two separate adolescent community samples: n = 1457, collected in 2006; and n = 191, collected in 2001. Two-, three-, and four-way interactions between the 5HTTLPR, positive and negative family environment, and sex were found in relation to both depressive symptoms and delinquency. However, the susceptibility properties of the 5HTTLPR were distinctly less pronounced in relation to depressive symptoms. If the assumption that the 5HTTLPR induces differential susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences is correct, the previous failures to measure and control for positive environmental factors might be a possible explanation for former inconsistent findings within the research field.",2018,,Journal of Neural Transmission,125,6,977-993,,10.1007/s00702-018-1854-8,,#2437,Åslund 2018,"",""
BDNF-Dependent Effects on Amygdala-Cortical Circuitry and Depression Risk in Children and Youth,"Wheeler, A.L.; Felsky, D.; Viviano, J.D.; Stojanovski, S.; Ameis, S.H.; Szatmari, P.; Lerch, J.P.; Chakravarty, M.M.; Voineskos, A.N.","The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for brain development, and the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is implicated in risk for mood disorders. The objective of this study was to determine how the Val66Met polymorphism influences amygdala-cortical connectivity during neurodevelopment and assess the relevance for mood disorders. Age- and sex-specific effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on amygdala-cortical connectivity were assessed by examining covariance of amygdala volumes with thickness throughout the cortex in a sample of Caucasian youths ages 8-22 that were part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n = 339). Follow-up analyses assessed corresponding BDNF genotype effects on resting-state functional connectivity (n = 186) and the association between BDNF genotype and major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 2749). In adolescents, amygdala-cortical covariance was significantly stronger in Met allele carriers compared with Val/Val homozygotes in amygdala-cortical networks implicated in depression; these differences were driven by females. In follow-up analyses, the Met allele was also associated with stronger resting-state functional connectivity in adolescents and increased likelihood of MDD in adolescent females. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may confer risk for mood disorders in females through effects on amygdala-cortical connectivity during adolescence, coinciding with a period in the lifespan when onset of depression often occurs, more commonly in females.",2018,,Cerebral Cortex,28,5,1760-1770,,10.1093/cercor/bhx086,,#2443,Wheeler 2018,"",""
Cortical Dysconnectivity Measured by Structural Covariance Is Associated With the Presence of Psychotic Symptoms in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome,"Sandini, C.; Scariati, E.; Padula, M.C.; Schneider, M.; Schaer, M.; Van De Ville, D.; Eliez, S.","Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the third-largest known genetic risk factor for the development of psychosis. Dysconnectivity has consistently been implicated in the physiopathology of psychosis. Structural covariance of cortical morphology is a method of exploring connectivity among brain regions that to date has not been employed in 22q11DS. Methods: In the present study we employed structural covariance of cortical thickness to explore connectivity alterations in a group of 108 patients with 22q11DS compared with 96 control subjects. We subsequently divided patients into two subgroups of 31 subjects each according to the presence of attenuated psychotic symptoms. FreeSurfer software was used to obtain the mean cortical thickness in 148 brain regions from T1-weighted 3T images. For each population we reconstructed a brain graph using Pearson correlation between the average thickness of each couple of brain regions, which we characterized in terms of mean correlation strength and in terms of network architecture using graph theory. Results: Patients with 22q11DS presented increased mean correlation strength, but there was no difference in global architecture compared with control subjects. However, symptomatic patients presented increased mean correlation strength coupled with increased segregation and decreased integration compared with both control subjects and nonsymptomatic patients. They also presented increased centrality for a cluster of anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal regions. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of cortical dysconnectivity in the physiopathology of psychosis. Moreover they support the significance of aberrant anterior cingulate connectivity.",2018,,Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,3,5,433-442,,10.1016/j.bpsc.2017.04.008,,#2444,Sandini 2018,"",""
Short-Term Genetic Selection for Adolescent Locomotor Sensitivity to Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),"Kasten, C.R.; Zhang, Y.; Mackie, K.; Boehm, S.L.","Cannabis use is linked to positive and negative outcomes. Identifying genetic targets of susceptibility to the negative effects of cannabinoid use is of growing importance. The current study sought to complete short-term selective breeding for adolescent sensitivity and resistance to the locomotor effects of a single 10 mg/kg THC dose in the open field. Selection for THC-locomotor sensitivity was moderately heritable, with the greatest estimates of heritability seen in females from the F2 to S3 generations. Selection for locomotor sensitivity also resulted in increased anxiety-like activity in the open field. These results are the first to indicate that adolescent THC-locomotor sensitivity can be influenced via selective breeding. Development of lines with a genetic predisposition for THC-sensitivity or resistance to locomotor effects allow for investigation of risk factors, differences in consequences of THC use, identification of correlated behavioral responses, and detection of genetic targets that may contribute to heightened cannabinoid sensitivity.",2018,,Behavior Genetics,48,3,224-235,,10.1007/s10519-018-9894-2,,#2445,Kasten 2018,"",""

Investigators will be recruiting both healthy control subjects and subjects with any form of dystonia. For this study there will be a maximum of two study visit involving a clinical assessment, collection of medical and family history, task training session, an MRI using the learned tasks, and finally a blood draw for genetic analysis. In total, these visits will take 3-5 hours. If the dystonia subjects receive botulinum toxin injections for treatment, the participants and their matched controls will be asked to come for a second visit.Detailed Description1. Identify a cohort of individuals with known dystonia-related gene mutations, and individuals with idiopathic but presumed-genetic dystonia. Some of these individuals may receive botulinum toxin injections to treat their dystonia per standard of care; in these patients, investigators will image before and after injections to assess for imaging correlates of treatment response. 2. Analyze DNA samples from both the dystonia and healthy individual cohorts to detect the presence of mutations and/or polymorphisms in genes associated with dystonia 3. Collect systematic clinical information, including Tsui Torticollis, Burke-Fahn-Marsden, Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), Voice Disability Index, Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Spielberg Trait Anxiety scales. Scales will be tailored to the type of dystonia, as determined by the clinician referring into the study (i.e., torticollis scales will only be performed on patients with cervical dystonia). 4. Use functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and structural MRI to a) analyze brain activity and structure pre- and post-botulinum toxin injections, b) determine how different stages of movement (execution, preparation, sequencing) influence dystonia and the underlying neural mechanisms, c) identify structural abnormalities shared between clinical sub-types of dystonia. As new MR imaging methods are introduced that may improve the investigators ability to identify or distinguish these abnormalities, the investigator will incorporate these novel sequences into the imaging protocol. 5.

Little is known, however, about brain networks in those at high risk (HR) of bipolar disorder (BD), with such disturbances carrying substantial predictive and etiological value. Whole-brain tractography was performed on diffusion-weighted images acquired from 84 unaffected HR individuals with at least one first-degree relative with BD, 38 young patients with BD and 96 matched controls (CNs) with no family history of mental illness. We studied structural connectivity differences between these groups, with a focus on highly connected hubs and networks involving emotional centres. HR participants showed lower structural connectivity in two lateralised sub-networks centred on bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left insular cortex, as well as increased connectivity in a right lateralised limbic sub-network compared with CN subjects. BD was associated with weaker connectivity in a small right-sided sub-network involving connections between fronto-temporal and temporal areas. Although these sub-networks preferentially involved structural hubs, the integrity of the highly connected structural backbone was preserved in both groups. Weaker structural brain networks involving key emotional centres occur in young people at genetic risk of BD and those with established BD. In contrast to other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, the structural core of the brain remains intact, despite the local involvement of network hubs. These results add to our understanding of the neurobiological correlates of BD and provide predictions for outcomes in young people at high genetic risk for BD.",2018,,Molecular Psychiatry,23,2,413-421,,10.1038/mp.2016.216,,#2455,Roberts 2018,"",For Mahnoor's review?

The present study used low-coverage whole genome sequence data to conduct set-based association and enrichment analyses of low frequency variation in protein-coding regions as well as regulatory regions in relation to cannabis dependence. Two cohorts were studied: a population-based Native American tribal community consisting of 697 participants nested within large multi-generational pedigrees and a family-based sample of 1832 predominantly European ancestry participants largely nested within nuclear families. Participants in both samples were assessed for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) lifetime cannabis dependence, with 168 and 241 participants receiving a positive diagnosis in each sample, respectively. Sequence kernel association tests identified one protein-coding region, C1orf110 and one regulatory region in the MEF2B gene that achieved significance in a meta-analysis of both samples. A regulatory region within the PCCB gene, a gene previously associated with schizophrenia, exhibited a suggestive association. Finally, a significant enrichment of regions within or near genes with multiple splice variants or involved in cell adhesion or potassium channel activity were associated with cannabis dependence.

From all father-offspring pairs where the father had AUD and the offspring was born 1960–1990, we identified not-lived-with (NLW) biological fathers (n = 38,376) and step-father pairs (n = 9,711). The relationship between clinical and historical features of the father's AUD and risk for AUD in offspring was assessed by linear hazard regression. Age at first registration for AUD and recurrence of AUD registration were significantly stronger predictors of risk for AUD in the offspring of NLW fathers than in step-fathers.

However, while the number of step-father AUD registrations that occurred when he was living them with significantly predicted risk for AUD in his step-children, the number of registrations that occurred when not residing with his step-children was unassociated with their AUD risk.

Twin studies indicate that half of the variation in this trait is genetic. Specific causal genetic variants have, however, not been identified. OBJECTIVES To estimate the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of ASB; to identify novel genetic risk variants, genes, or biological pathways; to test for pleiotropic associations with other psychiatric traits; and to reevaluate the candidate gene era data through the Broad Antisocial Behavior Consortium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Genome-wide association data from 5 large population-based cohorts and 3 target samples with genome-wide genotype and ASB data were used formeta-analysis from March 1, 2014, toMay 1, 2016. All data sets used quantitative phenotypes, except for the Finnish Crime Study, which applied a case-control design (370 patients and 5850 control individuals). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES This study adopted relatively broad inclusion criteria to achieve a quantitative measure of ASB derived from multiple measures, maximizing the sample size over different age ranges. RESULTS The discovery samples comprised 16 400 individuals, whereas the target samples consisted of 9381 individuals (all individuals were of European descent), including child and adult samples (mean age range, 6.7-56.1 years). Three promising loci with sex-discordant associations were found (8535 female individuals, chromosome 1: rs2764450, chromosome 11: rs11215217; 7772 male individuals, chromosome X, rs41456347). Polygenic risk score analyses showed prognostication of antisocial phenotypes in an independent Finnish Crime Study (2536 male individuals and 3684 female individuals) and shared genetic origin with conduct problems in a population-based sample (394 male individuals and 431 female individuals) but not with conduct disorder in a substance-dependent sample (950 male individuals and 1386 female individuals) (R2 = 0.0017 in the most optimal model, P = 0.03). Significant inverse genetic correlation of ASB with educational attainment (r =-0.52, P = .005) was detected. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Broad Antisocial Behavior Consortium entails the largest collaboration to date on the genetic architecture of ASB, and the first results suggest that ASB may be highly polygenic and has potential heterogeneous genetic effects across sex.",2017,,JAMA Psychiatry,74,12,1242-1250,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3069,,#2477,Tielbeek 2017,"",""

There are presently 28 cases of BBSOAS described in the literature. Its common features include developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, optic nerve atrophy, attention deficit disorder, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, hearing defects, spasticity, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Here we report two unrelated probands with novel, de novo, missense variants in NR2F1 The first is a 14-yr-old male patient with hypotonia, intellectual disability, optic nerve hypoplasia, delayed bone age, short stature, and altered neurotransmitter levels on cerebrospinal fluid testing. The second is a 5-yr-old female with severe developmental delay, motor and speech delay, and repetitive motion behavior. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel missense NR2F1 variant in each case, Cys86Phe in the DNA-binding domain in Case 1, and a Leu372Pro in the ligand-binding domain in Case 2. The presence of clinical findings compatible with BBSOAS along with structural analysis at atomic resolution using homology-based molecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulations, support the pathogenicity of these variants for BBSOAS. Short stature, abnormal CNS neurotransmitters, and macrocephaly have not been previously reported for this syndrome and may represent a phenotypic expansion of BBSOAS.

Melatonin Levels and Obesity,"","Brief SummaryBackground: Melatonin is a neurohormone that regulates the circadian rhythm by translating photoperiodic information from the eyes to the brain. Working hypothesis and aims: There is a possible link between circadian rhythm regulation and glucose homeostasis through melatonin pathways. We aim to examine the relation between melatonin levels and degree of obesity , in children and adolescents in different pubertal stages. Methods: The study group will include 24 children and adolescents in various stages of pubertal development. Participants will be categorized into 3 groups: 1) normal-weight, 2) obese subjects with metabolic syndrome, 3) obese without metabolic syndrome. Melatonin levels will be measured using saliva during the night. Expected results: We expect to find a relation between melatonin levels to the metrics of metabolic syndrome, sleep duration, number of television viewing hours and sense of depression. Importance: Childhood obesity is recognized as a major medical and public health problem and is strongly associated with many serious medical complications including the metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It is important to understand mechanisms involved in the development of obesity and hyperinsulinemia.

MTNR1B , is one of melatonin receptors which is expressed in the retina, in the brain and in pancreatic tissue. In Genome Wide Association studies a SNP in the intronic variant in MTNR1B was found to be to in association with elevated fasting plasma glucose and with increased risk of T2DM among lean and obese adults and children. Working hypothesis and aims: There is a possible link between circadian rhythm regulation and glucose homeostasis through melatonin pathways. We aim to examine the relation between melatonin levels and degree of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, in children and adolescents in different pubertal stages. Methods: The study group will include twenty-four children and adolescents in various stages of pubertal development. Participants will be categorized into three groups: 1) normal-weight, 2) obese subjects with metabolic syndrome, 3) obese without metabolic syndrome. Melatonin levels will be measured using saliva during the night. Each child will be measured for height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure. Fasting insulin, glucose and lipid profile will be taken. Each child will fill out questionnaires about depression, sleep quality and television usage. Expected results: We expect to find a relation between melatonin levels to the metrics of metabolic syndrome, sleep duration, number of television viewing hours and sense of depression. We expect to find lower levels of melatonin in the group of obese children with metabolic syndrome during night time. We expect that children with lower levels of melatonin should report on fewer hours of sleep, more hours of watching television and feeling more depressed. Importance: Childhood obesity is recognized as a major medical and public health problem and is strongly associated with many serious medical complications including the metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

"The Long Reach of Early Adversity: Parenting, Stress, and Neural Pathways to Antisocial Behavior in Adulthood","Gard, A.M.; Waller, R.; Shaw, D.S.; Forbes, E.E.; Hariri, A.R.; Hyde, L.W.","Background Early life adversities including harsh parenting, maternal depression, neighborhood deprivation, and low family economic resources are more prevalent in low-income urban environments and are potent predictors of psychopathology, including, for boys, antisocial behavior. However, little research has examined how these stressful experiences alter later neural function. Moreover, identifying genetic markers of greater susceptibility to adversity is critical to understanding biopsychosocial pathways from early adversity to later psychopathology. Methods Within a sample of 310 low-income boys followed from 1.5 to 20 years of age, multimethod assessments of adversities were examined at 2 and 12 years of age. At 20 years of age, amygdala reactivity to emotional facial expressions was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and symptoms of antisocial personality disorder were assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. Genetic variability in cortisol signaling (CRHR1) was examined as a moderator of pathways to amygdala reactivity. Results Observed parenting and neighborhood deprivation at 2 years of age each uniquely predicted amygdala reactivity to emotional faces at 20 years of age over and above other adversities measured at multiple developmental periods. Harsher parenting and greater neighborhood deprivation in toddlerhood predicted clinically significant symptoms of antisocial behavior via less amygdala reactivity to fearful facial expressions, and this pathway was moderated by genetic variation in CRHR1. Conclusions These results elucidate a pathway linking early adversity to less amygdala reactivity to social signals of interpersonal distress 18 years later, which in turn increased risk for serious antisocial behavior. Moreover, these findings suggest a genetic marker of youth more susceptible to adversity.",2017,,Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,2,7,582-590,,10.1016/j.bpsc.2017.06.005,,#2490,Gard 2017,"",""

Attention and motor deficits index non-specific background liabilities that predict autism recurrence in siblings,"Mous, S.E.; Jiang, A.; Agrawal, A.; Constantino, J.N.","Background: Recent research has demonstrated that subclinical autistic traits of parents amplify the effects of deleterious mutations in the causation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their offspring. Here, we examined the extent to which two neurodevelopmental traits that are non-specific to ASD - inattention/hyperactivity and motor coordination - might contribute to ASD recurrence in siblings of ASD probands. Methods: Data from a quantitative trait study of 114 ASD probands and their brothers, 26% of whom also had ASD, were analyzed. Autistic trait severity was ascertained using the Social Responsiveness Scale-2, attention/hyperactivity problems using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, and motor coordination (in a subset of participants) using the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire. Results: Among siblings (affected and unaffected), both categorical recurrence of ASD (Nagelkerke R 2 = 0.53) and quantitative ASD trait burden (R 2 = 0.55) were predicted by sibling ADHD and motor coordination impairment scores, even though these traits, on average, were not elevated among the unaffected siblings. Conclusions: These findings in a clinical family cohort confirm observations from general population studies that inattention/hyperactivity and motor impairment - axes of behavioral development that are non-specific to ASD, and often appreciable before ASD is typically diagnosed - jointly account for over 50% of the variation in autistic impairment of siblings, whether ascertained quantitatively or categorically. This finding within a sibling design suggests that background ASD susceptibilities that are inherited but non-specific (""BASINS"") may contribute to additive genetic liability in the same manner that ASD-specific susceptibilities (such as parental subclinical ASD traits and deleterious mutations) engender ASD risk.",2017,,Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9,1,,,10.1186/s11689-017-9212-y,,#2498,Mous 2017,"",""

We constructed polygenic scores for difficulties with language and learning to read from genome-wide data in ~6,600 children, adolescents and young adults, and tested their association with health, socioeconomic outcomes and brain structure measures collected in adults (maximal N = 111,749). Polygenic risk of reading difficulties was associated with reduced income, educational attainment, self-rated health and verbal-numerical reasoning (p < 0.00055). Polygenic risk of language difficulties predicted income (p = 0.0005). The small effect sizes ranged 0.01–0.03 of a standard deviation, but these will increase as genetic studies for reading ability get larger. Polygenic scores for childhood cognitive ability and educational attainment were correlated with polygenic scores of reading and language (up to 0.09 and 0.05, respectively). But when they were included in the prediction models, the observed associations between polygenic reading and adult outcomes mostly remained. This suggests that the pathway from reading ability to social outcomes is not only via associated polygenic loads for general cognitive function and educational attainment. The presence of non-overlapping genetic effect is indicated by the genetic correlations of around 0.40 (childhood intelligence) and 0.70 (educational attainment) with reading ability.

There is some evidence that this system may be involved in the genetic vulnerability to suicide. The aim of the present study was to analyze possible relationship between the GRIN2B polymorphism and suicidal behavior. We hypothesized that this genetic factor may be associated with suicide attempts in alcohol-dependent patients and with death by suicide. Methods: To analyze the relationship between GRIN2B and suicide attempts, the selected rs2268115 polymorphism was genotyped in a sample of 345 alcohol-dependent individuals stratified by the history of suicide attempts. The second part of the study concerning suicide was based on a sample of 510 suicide victims and 450 controls. Results: The frequency of rs2268115 G allele among alcohol-dependent patients with the history of suicide attempts was significantly higher than among non-suicidal alcohol-dependent individuals (OR = 1.45, p =.033). This association was more significant when analyzing alcohol-dependent patients only without co-occurring drug dependence (OR = 1.62, p =.021). The analyzed GRIN2B polymorphism was associated with a twofold increase in odds of a suicide attempt (OR = 2.01, p =.004). No relationships between rs2268115 and death by suicide were identified. Discussion and Conclusions: Our results suggest that glutamatergic system influence susceptibility to suicide attempts in alcohol-dependent individuals.

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown.

We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model, chronic variable stress, and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in both depressed humans and stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene Dusp6 in mouse prefrontal cortex mimicked stress susceptibility in females, but not males, by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such Dusp6 downregulation also recapitulated the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in prefrontal cortex of depressed females.

Genome-wide mediation analysis of psychiatric and cognitive traits through imaging phenotypes,"Bi, X.; Yang, L.; Li, T.; Wang, B.; Zhu, H.; Zhang, H.","Heritability is well documented for psychiatric disorders and cognitive abilities which are, however, complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Hence, it remains challenging to discover which and how genetic variations contribute to such complex traits. In this article, they propose to use mediation analysis to bridge this gap, where neuroimaging phenotypes were utilized as intermediate variables. The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort was investigated using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and mediation analyses. Specifically, 951 participants were included with age ranging from 8 to 21 years. Two hundred and four neuroimaging measures were extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. GWAS were conducted for each measure to evaluate the SNP-based heritability. Furthermore, mediation analyses were employed to understand the mechanisms in which genetic variants have influence on pathological behaviors implicitly through neuroimaging phenotypes, and identified SNPs that would not be detected otherwise. Our analyses found that rs10494561, located in the intron region within NMNAT2, was associated with the severity of the prodromal symptoms of psychosis implicitly, mediated through the volume of the left hemisphere of the superior frontal region (P=2.38×10-8).

Method: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and Individual Brain Atlases using Statistical Parametric Mapping (IBASPM) were used to assess GM density and volume in the cerebellum, respectively, in patients with MDD and the HCs. Indicators of emotional memory performance were measured, including the hit rate (HR), rate of false alarm (FA), precision (Pr = HR − FA) and emotional memory enhancement [∆Pr = Pr(emotion) − Pr(neutral)] values. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were used to measure the severity of depression. Results: In the patients with MDD, the GM density was decreased in three cerebellar cortical regions and increased in three cerebellar cortical regions (p <.005). The GM volumes in eight cerebellar cortical regions were significantly smaller in the patients with MDD than in the HC subjects (p <.05). In the patients with MDD, the GM volume was correlated with the ∆Pr (p <.05) in two cerebellar cortical regions. The BDI scores were significantly correlated with the relative GM densities (p <.05) in 5 cerebellar cortical regions, and the GM volumes in 13 cerebellar cortical regions were correlated with the BDI scores in patients with MDD. Conclusions: Emotional memory and the severity of depressive symptoms are associated with structural changes in both the posterior and anterior GM regions in the cerebellum in patients with MDD.

Examination of the effects of individual variants as well as aggregate genetic variation can clarify mechanisms underlying risk. Methods: We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in an ethnically diverse sample of college students for three quantitative outcomes including typical monthly alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, and maximum number of drinks in 24 h. Heritability based on common genetic variants (h2SNP) was assessed. We also evaluated whether risk variants in aggregate were associated with alcohol use outcomes in an independent sample of young adults. Results: Two genome-wide significant markers were observed: rs11201929 in GRID1 for maximum drinks in 24 h, with supportive evidence across all ancestry groups; and rs73317305 in SAMD12 (alcohol problems), tested only in the African ancestry group. The h2SNP estimate was 0.19 (SE = 0.11) for consumption, and was non-significant for other outcomes. Genome-wide polygenic scores were significantly associated with alcohol outcomes in an independent sample. Conclusions: These results robustly identify genetic risk for alcohol use outcomes at the variant level and in aggregate. We confirm prior evidence that genetic variation in GRID1 impacts alcohol use, and identify novel loci of interest for multiple alcohol outcomes in emerging adults. These findings indicate that genetic variation influencing normative and problematic alcohol use is, to some extent, convergent across ancestry groups.

We enrolled 11 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 and their parents, catalogued their clinical characteristics, and utilized a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray to identify CNVs in blood and saliva. The 11 twin pairs showed high concordance for presence and number of café-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, IQ, and ADHD.

Methadone is used to treat opioid dependence (OD), acting as a selective agonist at the μ-opioid receptor encoded by the gene OPRM1. Determining the optimal methadone maintenance dose is time consuming; currently, no biomarkers are available to guide treatment. In methadone-treated OD subjects drawn from a case and control sample, we conducted a genome-wide association study of usual daily methadone dose. In African-American (AA) OD subjects (n=383), we identified a genome-wide significant association between therapeutic methadone dose (mean=68.0 mg, s.d.=30.1 mg) and rs73568641 (P=2.8 × 10 -8), the nearest gene (306 kilobases) being OPRM1.

Method The study included 239 patients with psoriasis (15–76 years, 31.8% of women) and 123 healthy controls (17–74 years, 32.5% of women). Dependent variable in the analysis was Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. Explanatory variables included: age, sex, marital status, education, occupational activity, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, history of smoking, average number of smoked cigarettes, skin lesions visible to others, comorbidities, including arterial hypertension and arthritis, number of previous hospitalizations and family history of psoriasis. Results Psoriatics showed higher BDI scores than the controls, and significantly more often presented with depressiveness. Depressiveness correlated with psoriasis, older age, female sex, lack of higher education, occupational inactivity, higher BMI, visible skin lesions, comorbidities, including arterial hypertension and arthritis, greater number of previous hospitalizations and lack of family history of psoriasis.

The condition can result in considerable social stigma and poor quality of life, especially when tics are severe (for example, with coprolalia (swearing tics) and self-injurious behaviours) or when GTS is accompanied by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or another neuropsychiatric disorder. The aetiology is complex and multifactorial. GTS is considered to be polygenic, involving multiple common risk variants combined with rare, inherited or de novo mutations.

In the current study, we investigated the interplay between genetic risk variants, shifts in methylation and mRNA levels in whole blood from 223 adolescents distinguished by a risk for developing psychiatric disorders. We analyzed 37 SNPs previously associated with psychiatric diseases in relation to genome-wide DNA methylation levels using linear models, with Bonferroni correction and adjusting for cell-type composition. Associations between DNA methylation, mRNA levels and psychiatric disease risk evaluated by the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) score were identified by robust linear models, Pearson's correlations and binary regression models. We detected five SNPs (in HCRTR1, GAD1, HADC3 and FKBP5) that were associated with eight CpG sites, validating five of these SNP-CpG pairs. Three of these CpG sites, that is, cg01089319 (GAD1), cg01089249 (GAD1) and cg24137543 (DiAPH1), manifest in significant gene expression changes and overlap with active regulatory regions in chromatin states of brain tissues. Importantly, methylation levels at cg01089319 were associated with the DAWBA score in the discovery group.

In this preliminary study we analyzed genome-wide expression and methylation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children and adolescents from three matched groups: BD patients, unaffected offspring of bipolar parents (high risk) and controls (low risk). By integrating gene expression and DNA methylation and comparing the lists of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated probes between groups, we were able to identify 43 risk genes that discriminate patients and high-risk youth from controls. Pathway analysis showed an enrichment of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway with the genes MED1, HSPA1L, GTF2A1 and TAF15, which might underlie the previously reported role of stress response in the risk for BD in vulnerable populations. Cell-based assays indicate a GR hyporesponsiveness in cells from adult BD patients compared to controls and suggest that these GR-related genes can be modulated by DNA methylation, which poses the theoretical possibility of manipulating their expression as a means to counteract the familial risk presented by those subjects.

This latter is a constituent of traditional hashish, but is largely absent from modern high-potency forms of cannabis. Argument continues over the extent to which genetic predisposition is correlated to, or interacts with, cannabis use, and what proportion of psychosis could be prevented by minimizing heavy use. As yet, there is not convincing evidence that cannabis use increases risk of other psychiatric disorders, but there are no such doubts concerning its detrimental effect on cognitive function.

Cognitive function of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning difficulties: A developmental perspective,"Huang, F.; Sun, L.; Qian, Y.; Liu, L.; Ma, Q.-G.; Yang, L.; Cheng, J.; Cao, Q.-J.; Su, Y.; Gao, Q.; Wu, Z.-M.; Li, H.-M.; Qian, Q.-J.; Wang, Y.-F.","Background: The cognitive function of children with either attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or learning disabilities (LDs) is known to be impaired. However, little is known about the cognitive function of children with comorbid ADHD and LD. The present study aimed to explore the cognitive function of children and adolescents with ADHD and learning difficulties in comparison with children with ADHD and healthy controls in different age groups in a large Chinese sample. Methods: Totally, 1043 participants with ADHD and learning difficulties (the ADHD + learning difficulties group), 870 with pure ADHD (the pure ADHD group), and 496 healthy controls were recruited. To investigate the difference in cognitive impairment using a developmental approach, all participants were divided into three age groups (6-8, 9-11, and 12-14 years old). Measurements were the Chinese-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Stroop Color-Word Test, the Trail-Making Test, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Parents (BRIEF). Multivariate analysis of variance was used. Results: The results showed that after controlling for the effect of ADHD symptoms, the ADHD+ learning difficulties group was still significantly worse than the pure ADHD group, which was, in turn, worse than the control group on full intelligence quotient (98.66 ± 13.87 vs. 105.17 ± 14.36 vs. 112.93 ± 13.87, P < 0.001).

"Mood, stress and longevity: Convergence on ANK3","Rangaraju, S.; Levey, D.F.; Nho, K.; Jain, N.; Andrews, K.D.; Le-Niculescu, H.; Salomon, D.R.; Saykin, A.J.; Petrascheck, M.; Niculescu, A.B.","Antidepressants have been shown to improve longevity in C. elegans. It is plausible that orthologs of genes involved in mood regulation and stress response are involved in such an effect. We sought to understand the underlying biology. First, we analyzed the transcriptome from worms treated with the antidepressant mianserin, previously identified in a large-scale unbiased drug screen as promoting increased lifespan in worms. We identified the most robust treatment-related changes in gene expression, and identified the corresponding human orthologs. Our analysis uncovered a series of genes and biological pathways that may be at the interface between antidepressant effects and longevity, notably pathways involved in drug metabolism/degradation (nicotine and melatonin). Second, we examined which of these genes overlap with genes which may be involved in depressive symptoms in an aging non-psychiatric human population (n=3577), discovered using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach in a design with extremes of distribution of phenotype. Third, we used a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach to prioritize these genes for relevance to mood disorders and stress. The top gene identified was ANK3. To validate our findings, we conducted genetic and gene-expression studies, in C. elegans and in humans. We studied C. elegans inactivating mutants for ANK3/unc-44, and show that they survive longer than wild-type, particularly in older worms, independently of mianserin treatment. We also show that some ANK3/unc-44 expression is necessary for the effects of mianserin on prolonging lifespan and survival in the face of oxidative stress, particularly in younger worms. Wild-type ANK3/unc-44 increases in expression with age in C. elegans, and is maintained at lower youthful levels by mianserin treatment. These lower levels may be optimal in terms of longevity, offering a favorable balance between sufficient oxidative stress resistance in younger worms and survival effects in older worms. Thus, ANK3/unc-44 may represent an example of antagonistic pleiotropy, in which low-expression level in young animals are beneficial, but the age-associated increase becomes detrimental. Inactivating mutations in ANK3/unc-44 reverse this effect and cause detrimental effects in young animals (sensitivity to oxidative stress) and beneficial effect in old animals (increased survival). In humans, we studied if the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for depressive symptoms in ANK3 from our GWAS has a relationship to lifespan, and show a trend towards longer lifespan in individuals with the risk allele for depressive symptoms in men (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, P=0.031) but not in women (OR 1.08, P=0.33). We also examined whether ANK3, by itself or in a panel with other top CFG-prioritized genes, acts as a blood gene-expression biomarker for biological age, in two independent cohorts, one of live psychiatric patients (n=737), and one of suicide completers from the coroner's office (n=45). We show significantly lower levels of ANK3 expression in chronologically younger individuals than in middle age individuals, with a diminution of that effect in suicide completers, who presumably have been exposed to more severe and acute negative mood and stress. Of note, ANK3 was previously reported to be overexpressed in fibroblasts from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a form of accelerated aging. Taken together, these studies uncover ANK3 and other genes in our dataset as biological links between mood, stress and longevity/aging, that may be biomarkers as well as targets for preventive or therapeutic interventions. Drug repurposing bioinformatics analyses identified the relatively innocuous omega-3 fatty acid DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), piracetam, quercetin, vitamin D and resveratrol as potential longevity promoting compounds, along with a series of existing drugs, such as estrogen-like compounds, antidiabetics and sirolimus/rapamycin. Intriguingly, some of our top candidate genes for mood and stress-modulated longevity were changed in expression in opposite direction in previous studies in the Alzheimer disease. Additionally, a whole series of others were changed in expression in opposite direction in our previous studies on suicide, suggesting the possibility of a ""life switch"" actively controlled by mood and stress.",2016,,Molecular Psychiatry,21,8,1037-1049,,10.1038/mp.2016.65,,#2609,Rangaraju 2016,"",""

Identification of contributing genes and pathways may improve understanding of aetiology and facilitate therapy and prevention. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study of pathological gambling. Our aims were to identify pathways involved in pathological gambling, and examine whether there is a genetic overlap between pathological gambling and alcohol dependence. Methods: Four hundred and forty-five individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were recruited in Germany, and 986 controls were drawn from a German general population sample. A genome-wide association study of pathological gambling comprising single marker, gene-based, and pathway analyses, was performed.

Sleep Spindle Deficit in Schizophrenia: Contextualization of Recent Findings,"Castelnovo, A.; D’Agostino, A.; Casetta, C.; Sarasso, S.; Ferrarelli, F.","Sleep spindles are wax and waning brain oscillations at a frequency range of 11–16 Hz, lasting 0.5–2 s, that define non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 2. Over the past few years, several independent studies pointed to a decrease of sleep spindles in schizophrenia. The aim of this review is to contextualize these findings within the growing literature on these oscillations across other neuro-psychiatric disorders. Indeed, spindles reflect the coordinated activity of thalamocortical networks, and their abnormality can be observed in a variety of conditions that disrupt local or global thalamocortical connectivity. Although the broad methodological variability across studies limits the possibility of drawing firm conclusions, impaired spindling activity has been observed in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite such lack of specificity, schizophrenia remains the only condition with a typical late adolescence to young adulthood onset in which impaired spindling has been consistently reported. Further research is necessary to clearly define the pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to this deficit and the validity of its widespread use as a clinical biomarker.",2016,,Current Psychiatry Reports,18,8,,,10.1007/s11920-016-0713-2,,#2611,Castelnovo 2016,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

It is not clear, however, whether these changes are causative or result from illness progression or treatment. To disentangle these possibilities we profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in well, unrelated individuals at high familial risk of mood disorder. DNA methylation was compared between individuals who subsequently developed BD or MDD [ill later (IL)] and those who remained well [well later (WL)]. Methods: DNA methylation profiles were obtained from whole-blood samples from 22 IL and 23 WL individuals using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Differential methylation was assessed on a single-locus and regional basis. Pathway analysis was performed to assess enrichment for particular biological processes amongst nominally significantly differentially methylated loci. Results: Although no locus withstood correction for multiple testing, uncorrected P-values provided suggestive evidence for altered methylation at sites within genes previously implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) and Interleukin 1 Receptor Accessory Protein-Like 1 ([IL1RAPL1]; P≤3.11×10−5). Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment for several neurologically relevant pathways and functions, including Nervous System Development and Function and Behavior; these findings withstood multiple testing correction (q≤0.05). Analysis of differentially methylated regions identified several within the major histocompatibility complex (P≤.000 479), a region previously implicated in schizophrenia and BD.

Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence.

A weighty matter: Identification and management of overweight and obesity in adolescents,"Peer, N.; Ganie, Y.N.","Overweight and obesity are common in South African boys (18.8%) and girls (26.3%). Considering the potential serious consequences of these conditions, clinicians need to identify overweight and obese adolescents to enable early diagnosis and treatment. The key contributor in adolescents is increased intake of unhealthy foods and lower levels of physical activity. The consequences of overweight and obesity in adolescence are multisystemic and include cardiometabolic (type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia), respiratory (obstructive sleep apnoea), gastrointestinal (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), musculoskeletal, psychological (depression) and social (stigmatisation) effects. Body mass index (BMI) is calculated to determine overweight and obesity in adolescents. Numerous expert committees, despite using different methods, classify overweight and obesity in children by age- and gender-specific cut points for BMI. After a diagnosis of overweight and obesity, secondary causes must be excluded, and a history of dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour obtained. This will identify modifiable behaviours that promote energy imbalance. All obese adolescents should undergo cardiometabolic assessments comprising fasting glucose, lipid and blood pressure measurements every 2 years. Interventions should focus on creating healthier home environments that provide easy access to healthy foods, encourage physical activity and discourage sedentary behaviour.

Concussion in the Military: an Evidence-Base Review of mTBI in US Military Personnel Focused on Posttraumatic Headache,"Holtkamp, M.D.; Grimes, J.; Ling, G.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as an alteration in brain function caused by an external force. Mild TBI or concussion is now well recognized to be a risk of military service as well as participation in athletic sports such as football.

The following is an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical course, prognosis, complications, and treatment of mTBI and associated comorbidities with a focus on PTH. There is a particular emphasis on emerging evidence-based clinical practice. One important medical consequence of the recognition that mTBI is a highly prevalent among military service members is that the Department of Defense (DoD) is dedicating significant financial and intellectual resources to better understanding and developing treatments for TBI. The identification of the importance of TBI among the US military population has had the added benefit of increasing awareness of this condition among civilian populations, particularly those engaged in both professional and youth sports. The NIH and NSF are also supporting important TBI research. President Obama’s Brain Initiative is also providing additional impetus for these efforts. Unfortunately, the understanding of the acute and chronic effects of mTBI on the brain remains limited.

Reward Processing and Risk for Depression Across Development,"Luking, K.R.; Pagliaccio, D.; Luby, J.L.; Barch, D.M.","Striatal response to reward has been of great interest in the typical development and psychopathology literatures. These parallel lines of inquiry demonstrate that although typically developing adolescents show robust striatal response to reward, adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and those at high risk for MDD show a blunted response to reward. Understanding how these findings intersect is crucial for the development and application of early preventative interventions in at-risk children, ideally before the sharp increase in the rate of MDD onset that occurs in adolescence. Robust findings relating blunted striatal response to reward and MDD risk are reviewed and situated within a normative developmental context. We highlight the need for future studies investigating longitudinal development, specificity to MDD, and roles of potential moderators and mediators. Offspring of depressed mothers are at increased risk for developing depression and show blunted responses to reward, relative to low-risk peers, within the dorsal and ventral striatum.The strongest evidence for the relationship between depression risk and blunted striatal response to reward has been found during mid-adolescence, a time in development when healthy low-risk groups show maximal striatal response to reward.Blunted striatal response to reward is not simply a consequence of experiencing depression because both never-depressed high-risk adolescents and currently depressed adolescents show a similarly blunted striatal response to reward relative to low-risk controls.Blunted striatal response to reward may specifically relate to maternal depression, and not to maternal anxiety.Blunted striatal response to reward may co-occur with enhanced responses to loss of reward or punishment in high-risk groups.",2016,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,20,6,456-468,,10.1016/j.tics.2016.04.002,,#2626,Luking 2016,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Common mental disorders during this period are mood, anxiety and substance related, with adolescents often presenting with comorbidity. Healthcare practitioners should screen for adolescent mental illness and associated suicide risk. Brief screening tools such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire are useful in detecting mood and anxiety disorders in primary care settings.

We analyzed in three psychiatric cohorts under psychotropic treatment the association of weighted genetic risk scores (w-GRSs) with BMI by integrating BMI-related polymorphisms from the candidate-gene approach and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Materials and methods w-GRS of 32 polymorphisms associated previously with BMI in general population GWAS and 20 polymorphisms associated with antipsychoticsinduced weight gain were investigated in three independent psychiatric samples. Results w-GRS of 32 polymorphisms were significantly associated with BMI in the psychiatric sample 1 (n=425) and were replicated in another sample (n=177).

Recent Advances in Understanding and Managing Tourette Syndrome,"Jankovic, J.; Thenganatt, M.A.","Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurologic and behavioral disorder consisting of motor and phonic tics with onset in childhood or adolescence. The severity of tics can range from barely perceptible to severely impairing due to social embarrassment, discomfort, self-injury, and interference with daily functioning and school or work performance. In addition to tics, most patients with TS have a variety of behavioral comorbidities, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Studies evaluating the pathophysiology of tics have pointed towards dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit, but the mechanism of this hyperkinetic movement disorder is not well understood. Treatment of TS is multidisciplinary, typically involving behavioral therapy, oral medications, and botulinum toxin injections.

Objective: The current study introduces an integrated model that combines neighborhood, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Methods: Hypotheses were tested with a sample of 99 African American women from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS). Results: Allele variants of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) interact with neighborhood crime to predict depressive symptoms in a manner consonant with the differential susceptibility perspective. Furthermore, this association is mediated by DNA methylation of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene.

Admixture analysis of age at symptom onset and age at disorder onset in a large sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Albert, U.; Manchia, M.; Tortorella, A.; Volpe, U.; Rosso, G.; Carpiniello, B.; Maina, G.","Background: A number of studies tested for the presence of different homogeneous subgroups of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients depending on the age at onset (AAO). However, none of the various thresholds of AAO have been validated. No study examined whether age at symptoms onset (ASO) and age at disorder onset (ADO) each define specific and diverse OCD subgroups. Methods: We used normal distribution mixture analysis in a sample of 483 OCD patients to test whether we could identify subgroups of patients according to the AAO. We tested whether ASO and ADO had different distributions and identified different subgroups of OCD patients, and whether clinical correlates had similar patterns of associations with patients subgroups identified with ASO or ADO. Results: The mixture analysis showed a trimodal distribution for ASO (mean ASO: 6.9 years for the early onset, 14.99 years for the intermediate onset, and 27.7 years for the late onset component), and confirmed a bimodal distribution for ADO (mean ADO: 18.0 and 29.5 years). Significant differences in the clinical profile of the subgroups emerged, particularly when identified using ASO. Limitations: Limitations of our study are the retrospective investigation of AAO, and the fact that our sample may not represent the OCD population, as we enrolled patients referring to a tertiary center specialized in the treatment of OCD. Our findings need to be confirmed in community samples. Another limitation is the lack of information on medication status at enrollment. Conclusions: Age at symptom onset and ADO showed distinct patterns of distributions. Similarly, phenotypic delineation was specific for ASO and ADO identified subgroups. Accurate clinical and biological profiling of ADO and ASO subgroups might show distinct genetic liabilities, ultimately leading to better nosological models and possibly to improved treatment decision making of OCD patients.",2015,,Journal of Affective Disorders,187,"(Albert U., umberto.albert@unito.it) Rita Levi Montalcini Department of Neuroscience, Anxiety and Mood Disorders Unit, University of Turin, Italy Via Cherasco 11, Torino, Italy(Manchia M.; Carpiniello B.)

Neural and Stress Correlates of Resilience in an Exercise-behavioural Programme,"","Brief SummaryStress-related disorders have a profound impact on public health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) found major depressive disorder (MDD) to be one of the most important human health problems with a prevalence of about 10%. In the current proposal the aim is to investigate mechanisms of resilience against stress-related disorders and to examine changes in quality of life, health, brain structure and brain function in individuals performing a ""resilience"" programme. Therefore, the investigators will recruit forty healthy subjects from the hospital staff exposed to ""normal"" day-to-day stress and not participating already in a fitness programme. Half of the subjects will be randomised to a cognitive behavioural self-experience and exercise programme for 20 weeks carried out by experienced supervisors, coaches and trainers. Clinical psychological and psychiatric examinations will be carried out weekly and a range of sophisticated neuroimaging techniques - high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and functional MRI (fMRI) - will be conducted before and after the ""resilience"" program in order to investigate its effectiveness on brain structure and function. The stress system will also be tested by examining cortisol awaking response (CAR) and daily rhythms of cortisol secretion. These techniques are all well established in our laboratories. The proposed research will likely stimulate the development of new prevention strategies for this common and important disorder, and in the future could be applied to other illnesses. Moreover, when successful it could be patented and offered for implementation in the daily routine of median to large companies.Detailed DescriptionMental disorders are a major cause of long-term disability and are a direct cause of mortality, with approximately 800,000 individuals dying from suicide every year worldwide - a high proportion of them arise from major depressive disorder (MDD). Knowledge of MDD has expanded in recent years by detecting that neuroplasticity may play a core role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Neuroplasticity in this context refers to the brain's ability to change and thus might be the presupposition for building up strategies against mental disorders. The best-characterized and most studied examples of neuroplasticity are the molecular and cellular adaptations underlying learning and exercise. Exercise improves cognition, has antidepressant effects and was also found to have positive effects on the brain structure as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Further, research in older adults indicates that increased aerobic fitness can be neuroprotective and can enhance brain structure and function. Increase of gray matter volume in parietal and frontal brain regions and corresponding increases of diffusivity in white matter fibres were seen as early as after 2 weeks of training a balancing task. On the other hand experimental studies found that stress and chronic exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids leads to depressive-like states. These states were accompanied by atrophy and loss of neurons in the adult hippocampus which is a temporal lobe brain region involved in learning, memory and mood regulation. Hippocampal damage, resulting from excessive exposure of the brain to glucocorticoids, leads to impaired feedback inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by glucocorticoids, causing unrestrained release of the axis - the ""Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis"". Prolonged stress, or an excess allostatic load, is thus harmful and is probably important in the processes mediating dementias. Efficient stress responses are necessary to cope with changes in the environment and an ability to terminate the stress response is of central importance in the return to homeostasis. Individuals with depression have relatively high cortisol secretory tone with blunted diurnal secretory patterns of cortisol secretion, reflecting poor regulatory feedback in the hippocampus. Higher cortisol stress responses to awakening (CAR), conversely, are found in those who are chronically stressed, depressed or remitted from depression or bipolar disorder, and in adolescents who will later develop depression. Interestingly, the investigators found that structural changes of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory and emotion regulation, become more pronounced when a patient with depression develops a chronic disease course. Recently, they detected that hippocampal volumes from patients with MDD, who carry also a genetic risk-allele (SLC6A4, 5-HTTLPR), were smaller when they had a history of emotional neglect compared to patients who had only the genetic or the emotional neglect risk factor separately. In the context of neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which is a significant step forward for characterizing microstructural changes or differences, is highly interesting. Using high angular resolution diffusion imaging, the investigators found that unaffected healthy first degree relatives of patients with MDD with stronger fiber connections between prefrontal and temporo-parietal brain regions managed incidences of early life adversity without later developing depression suggesting that resilience may be associated with stronger connections. This line of research suggests that structural and functional brain changes are already there before the manifestation of the disease and that these changes seem to be related to the individuals' vulnerability. Thus, preventing these brain changes, normalizing the stress functions and increasing the resilience of individuals is a major challenge for the future in order to prevent major stress-related mental disorders. The ability of the brain to adapt suggests that it might be possible to increase resilience in order to protect an individual from becoming depressed. In addition to exercise and learning, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and remediation programs have been shown to have effects on brain structure and function in patients with manifest disorders like depression or schizophrenia and especially the combination of CBT with exercise and learning might result in most prominent outcomes. Neuroplastic brain changes have been reported with CBT. For example, behavioral activation therapy for depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with positive stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors, resulted in decreased activations in prefrontal structures, including the paracingulate gyrus, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the right frontal pole, while symptoms of depression improved. Elevated amygdala-hippocampal activity decreased and reduced ACC activity increased during 16 weeks of CBT in 16 patients with MDD. A recent review highlights the effects of brief working memory training across different studies on brain activation in multiple regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex. Interestingly, cycling has been shown to increase the volume of the hippocampus in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects, with no change in the non-exercise group of patients. This suggests that CBT and exercise can have an impact on the recovery of the brain system from conditions like schizophrenia and MDD. Effects of a resilience program have never been investigated with neuroimaging, although it would be possible to achieve information about the structure of the white matter fiber bundles that connect certain brain regions. Psychological constructs that promote resilience - the ability to cope with stressful situations - include commitment, patience, optimism and self-esteem, in addition to the capacity to modulate emotions and to develop adaptive social behavior. These traits implicate the brain's cognitive-emotional interplay, which seems to be a critical determinant of the emergence of pathological rather than resilient phenotypes. The cognitive-emotional interplay and its functional brain connectivity can be studied using functional MRI. Interestingly, using functional MRI it has been shown that a bias between emotional and cognitive processing exists in patients with MDD. Aims: The aim of the current proposal is to carry out a 20 weeks lasting extensive resilience program in order to stimulate resilience in a healthy unaffected population that is exposed to normal day-to-day work stress in the hospital. The investigators will measure the effectiveness of this program by examining behavioral, diurnal cortisol secretion rhythms and stress responses, microstructural as well as functional neural changes. Hypotheses: The ""Resilience"" program stimulates resilience indicated by 1. improved mood stability, better sleep quality and higher life quality 2. increase of hippocampal and anterior cingulate cortex volumes 3. increase of functional connectivity between frontal and limbic brain regions. 4. increase of fractional anisotropy (FA), which is a measure for the functioning of white matter fibers, between limbic and frontal brain regions. 5. increased gradient of the diurnal secretion in cortisol; and decrease in stress responses as measured by the cortisol awakening response Methods and Materials Participants Forty healthy volunteers, e.g. from Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin (AMiNCH) staff, will be recruited. They will have no history of neurological, mental (axis I and axis II) or chronic internal diseases. Further exclusion criteria for all participants will be a previous head injury with loss of consciousness. Moreover, they will not be members of fitness clubs or engage in intensive day to day activity. The 40 healthy volunteers will be randomized to a 20 week ""resilience"" program, 45 minutes exercise two times per week under the supervision of a physiotherapist as well as 2 home session; or to a control group without this program, and a further two sessions of 45-minute exercise/jogging will be completed each week Clinical assessments will be done weekly. Neuroimaging and salivary cortisol awaking tests will be carried out at baseline and after 20 weeks for both the resilience program group (N=20) and the control group (N=20). Clinical assessments The NEO-FFI personality questionnaire and structured clinical interview for DSM disorders (SCID)-I and II will be carried out initially to exclude and history of, or current, psychiatric disorder. Mood will be assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline and then bi-weekly. Moreover, current life stressors will be evaluated in an interview conducted according to Keller et al. on a weekly basis; Life quality (Study-Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36, QoL-Bref) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), will also be carried out bi-weekly. Early life stress will be assessed using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ). The NEO-FFI personality questionnaire and SCID-I and II will also be carried out at inclusion once. Handedness will be determined by the Edinburgh inventory. Neuroimaging techniques MRI images will be obtained with a 3.0 Tesla MRI (Phillips Achieva), located in the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience (TCIN). MRI will be carried out using a 60 minutes imaging protocol. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI): In vivo DTI will be acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with SENSE parallel imaging scheme (SENSivitiy Encoding). The diffusion weighting will be encoded in 61 independent directions. After pre-processing in the program ExploreDTI, tractography with ExploreDTI and tract-based spatial statistics using TBSS (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/tbss/index.html, FSL) will be carried out. We have experience in using these technique and performing the analyses (25). Functional MRI: In order to identify functional changes in the emotion regulation system, we will apply an fMRI paradigm. We will use an Echo Planar Imaging (EPI), T2\*-weighted gradient-echo imaging to visualise BOLD contrast (TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, flip angle of 90°, matrix 80 x 80, FOV 224 x 224 x 150 mm, resolution: 3.5 x 3.5 mm, slice thickness: 3.5 mm). A cognitive-emotional inhibition task, which is well established in our laboratory, will be used. Participants will be asked to process visual emotional stimuli either in emotional or cognitive way. This task is chosen specifically, because it is known to elicit activity in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, gyrus cinguli, orbitofrontal cortex, regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD. SPM8-based standard analysis, functional connectivity analysis (33) and Psycho-Physiological Interaction (PPI) analysis will be done. Structural techniques: Additionally, the aim is to track any structural changes and to confirm as well as extend recent findings in this area. Therefore, all subjects will be scanned with a T1-weighted 3D-MPRAGE sequence (repetition time, 8.5 ms; echo time, 3.5 ms; total acquisition time, 7 min 30 sec; number of acquisitions, 1; field of view, 250 x 256 x 160 mm; resolution: 0.86x0.86x0.86 mm). Region of interest (ROI) analysis of the hippocampus and amygdala as well as optimised voxel-based morphometry (VBM) will be used for data analysis as previously done in our lab. Saliva cortisol samples These will be collected by participating subjects on two successive week-days, or working days. Subjects spit into a small plastic tube at wakening, and 30, 45, 60 and 90 min later; and in the evening (12h after waking) and just prior to going to bed. The samples can be stored by participants in a domestic fridge and posted in batch in a prepared envelope to the research centre. Calculation of sample size The investigators have previously conducted a number of longitudinal imaging studies. Based on these experiences, 20 subjects in each group should be more than sufficient to obtain significant effects, where signal changes in the order of 0.2% to 0.3% are typically found in cognitive-emotional tasks or at least 5 % microstructural changes should be found in structural MRI or DTI. Thus, with 20 subjects the effects should be detectable.",2015,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2671,,"",""

The Influence of Psychobiological Adversity to Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes,"","Brief SummaryThe aims of this study are two fold: To show whether there is an increased environmental or genetic susceptibility to stress in patients with T1D and whether it influences diabetes management. And to develop a strategy for the assessment and treatment of patients with T1D and an increased risk for development of psychopathology under stress.Detailed DescriptionLately, a marked increase in the incidence and earlier age of onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been noted. These observations could also be connected to an increased prevalence of stressful experiences and a lowered stress tolerance in some children. The way a person responds to stress is determined by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental experiences at specific times of development have been shown to shape individual's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) stress response. It is known, that early development of central nervous system is critically dependent on child's interaction with the environment (experience dependent maturation), especially to the attachment to caregivers (most often the mother). Appropriate caregiving is connected to lower basal cortisol levels in children and a more stable HPA axis response after the exposure to stress. Any circumstances that disturbed the formation of the attachment to the primary caregiver (e.g. complications at delivery, psychosocial stressors affecting the mother or mother's postpartum depression) resulted in higher HPA axis responsiveness to stress in the affected children. Changes in individual genes have also been shown to influence a person's susceptibility to stress and risk for the development of stress-induced psychopathology.",2015,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2675,,"",""

We examined function and structure of the amygdala and associated areas in a group of unaffected children of depressed parents (at-risk group) and a group of children of parents without a history of major depression (control group). Compared to the control group, the at-risk group showed increased activation to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions in the amygdala and multiple cortical regions, and decreased activation to happy relative to neutral facial expressions in the anterior cingulate cortex and supramarginal gyrus. At-risk children also exhibited reduced amygdala volume.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of LPHN3 variants in childhood ADHD susceptibility and treatment response in a naturalistic clinical cohort. The association between LPHN3 and ADHD was evaluated in 523 children and adolescents with ADHD and 132 controls. In the pharmacogenetic study, 172 children with ADHD were investigated. The primary outcome measure was the parent-rated Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Scale - version IV applied at baseline, first and third months of treatment with MPH.

Ethical issues associated with genetic counseling in the context of adolescent psychiatry,"Ryan, J.; Virani, A.; Austin, J.C.","Genetic counseling is a well-established healthcare discipline that provides individuals and families with health information about disorders that have a genetic component in a supportive counseling encounter. It has recently been applied in the context of psychiatric disorders (like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and anxiety) that typically appear sometime during later childhood through to early adulthood. Psychiatric genetic counseling is emerging as an important service that fills a growing need to reframe understandings of the causes of mental health disorders. In this review, we will define psychiatric genetic counseling, and address important ethical concerns (we will particularly give attention to the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice) that must be considered in the context of its application in adolescent psychiatry, whilst integrating evidence regarding patient outcomes from the literature. We discuss the developing capacity and autonomy of adolescents as an essential and dynamic component of genetic counseling provision in this population and discuss how traditional viewpoints regarding beneficence and non-maleficence should be considered in the unique situation of adolescents with, or at risk for, psychiatric conditions. We argue that thoughtful and tailored counseling in this setting can be done in a manner that addresses the important health needs of this population while respecting the core principles of biomedical ethics, including the ethic of care.",2015,,Applied and Translational Genomics,5,"(Ryan J.; Austin J.C., jehannine.austin@ubc.ca) Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada(Virani A., alice.virani@cw.bc.ca; Austin J.C., jehannine.austin@ubc.ca) Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Colum",23-29,,10.1016/j.atg.2015.06.001,,#2690,Ryan 2015,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

To examine factors associated with weight change and obesity risk in young and middle-aged adults. Subjects/methods. The Young Finns Study with its 923 women and 792 men aged 2439 years at baseline were followed for six years. Variables associated with the weight change were investigated with regression models. Results. The average weight change was 0.45 kg/year in women and 0.58 kg/year in men. In women, weight change was steady across all ages. In men, weight changes were more pronounced in younger age groups. In women (weight gain > 2 kg, n = 490), medication for anxiety, low occupational status, high baseline BMI (body mass index), high intake of sweet beverages, high childhood BMI, high salt (NaCl and/or KCl) use, low number of children, low childhood family income, high stature and low level of dependence (a temperament subscale) were associated with increased weight gain (in the order of importance). In men (weight gain > 2 kg, n = 455), high stature, high intake of french fries, low intake of sweet cookies, young age, recent divorce, low intake of cereals, high intake of milk, depressive symptoms, rural childhood origin, high baseline BMI and unemployment were associated with more pronounced weight gain.

Though it is well recognized that stressrelated vulnerabilities increase during adolescence, not all adolescent individuals are uniformly affected by stress nor do stressful experiences inevitability lead to negative outcomes. Indeed, many adolescents show resilience to stress-induced dysfunctions. However, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms that may mediate resilience to stress in adolescence. The goal of this brief review is to bring together a few separate, yet related lines of research that highlight specific variables that may influence stress resilience during adolescence, including early life programming of the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis, stress inoculation, and genetic predisposition.

Lack of association of polymorphisms in six candidate genes in Colombian adhd patients,"Fonseca, D.J.; Mateus, H.E.; Gálvez, J.M.; Forero, D.A.; Gutierrez, C.T.; Meerbeke, A.V.","Background: Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood neuropsychiatric condition. The disorder has a multifactorial background, with heritability estimates of around 76%, suggesting an important role of genetic factors. Candidate genes include those related to dopaminergic (e.g. DRD4, DRD5, SLC6A3 and DBH)and serotoninergic (e.g.HTR1B and SLC6A4) pathways. Purpose: To explore the association of common polymorphisms in six genes (DRD4, DRD5, SLC6A3, DBH, HTR1B and SLC6A4) and the susceptibility to ADHD in a Colombian sample population. Methods: Eighty-six ADHD trios and 152 healthy controls were recruited. Genotyping of the six polymorphisms was performed using described PCR-based protocols. A TDT analysis was used to test if there was preferential allelic transmission for any of the six polymorphisms. Additionally, a case-control analysis was performed to test for association of the serotoninergic (HTR1B and SLC6A4) polymorphisms with ADHD. Results: Through the TDT analysis there was no preferential allelic transmission for any of the studied variants. Case-control analysis did not show association. Conclusion: This is the first study in Latin America to describe six polymorphisms in a group of patients with ADHD.

Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics, cross tabulation and Chi square (X<sup>2</sup>) tests were employed. Results: Majority of the target group was normal (N=58, 28%) while a quarter of the sample suffers from mild depression (N=54, 26.1%).

Separation anxiety: At the neurobiological crossroads of adaptation and illness,"Battaglia, M.","Physiological and adaptive separation anxiety (SA) is intimately connected with the evolutionary emergence of new brain structures specific of paleomammalians, the growth of neomammalian-and later hominid-brain and skull size, and the appearance of bipedalism. All these evolutionary milestones have contributed to expanding the behavioral repertoire and plasticity of prehuman and human beings, at the cost of more prolonged dependency of the infant and of the child on parental care. Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) can be seen as an exaggerated/inappropriate manifestation of SA that constitutes a gateway to poorer mental and physical health. By blending epidemiological, genetic-epidemiological, endophenotypic, and animal laboratory approaches, it is possible to delineate some of the mechanisms that link childhood-adolescence SA and SAD to health problems later in life.

Genetic Heterogeneity in Adolescents' Depressive Symptoms in Response to Victimization,"Gottfredson, N.C.; Foshee, V.A.; Ennett, S.T.; Haberstick, B.; Smolen, A.","This study had two objectives: first, to determine the degree to which experiences of victimization by peers during adolescence led to a subsequent rise in depressive symptoms, and second, to identify genetic markers that predict depressive reactivity to victimization. We used a cohort sequential design to obtain a longitudinal sample of 1,475 adolescents (3,263 observations) in Grades 8 to 12 (56% female; 47% Black, 46% White). Multilevel growth curve models were used to assess whether victimization predicted depressive symptoms 6 months later, beyond baseline trajectories for depressive symptoms. We modeled the interactive effects of peer victimization with three genetic polymorphisms (on 5-HTTLPR, DRD2 TaqIA, and BDNF Val66Met) on depressive symptoms. Although victimization predicted subsequent depressive symptoms, there was substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of the effect of victimization. Val alleles, associated with higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) functioning, predicted more sensitivity to victimization. Neither DRD2 TaqIA, a marker associated with dopaminergic functioning, nor 5-HTTLPR, a marker associated with serotonin activity, was associated with sensitivity to victimization. The social stress of peer victimization triggers depressive symptoms most strongly in individuals who are homozygous for the Val allele on the BDNF Val/Met polymorphism.

The present study sought to identify (a) when interpersonal cognitions mature as risk factors for depressive symptoms by examining whether these factors are stable and predict symptoms across time in childhood, and (b) the extent to which interpersonal cognitions reflect inherited/environmental risks on children's depressive symptoms. Results showed that there was some stability for interpersonal cognitive biases from age 8 to 10 years (rs = .32-.43). Only the absence of positive self/other perceptions, and negative peer and mother expectations at age 8 predicted depressive symptoms at age 10 (after controlling for depressive symptoms at age 8).

Multicenter Study on Factors Influencing Real-life Social Functioning of People With a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia,"","Brief SummaryIn the last decades the impact of several variables on patients' social functioning has been investigated with conflicting findings. The involved variables might be grouped in three main categories: a) disease-related variables; b) personal resources; c) context-related factors. The present study is aimed to identify factors that affect most real-life functioning of subjects with schizophrenia and to assess negative and depressive symptoms, neurocognitive deficits and impairment of social cognition. Domains of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions most associated with impairment of real-life functioning will be identified and appropriate data analyses will be carried out to define whether it has a direct or indirect impact on real-life functioning. The research units of Turin and Genua will also investigate the relationships between insight into the illness and real-life social functioning. The research unit of Genua will evaluate prevalence and course of depressive symptoms, insight impairment and neurocognitive deficits, and will define the relationships of these aspects with suicidal behavior and real-life social functioning. The Naples research unit n.1 will investigate the hypothesis that deficits of preattentive and perceptual functions underlie impaired social cognition and negative symptoms. An electrophysiological study will be carried out in which abnormalities of event-related components and gamma rhythm synchronization, relevant to preattentive and perceptual stages of information processing, will be studied as endophenotypes of the disorder. The study will also investigate the heritability of disease-related variables by evaluating them in non-affected, first-degree relatives of subjects with schizophrenia. The research unit of Bari will test functionality of genetic variants relevant to dopaminergic signaling, that might confer risk for neurocognitive and related prefrontal dysfunction assessed by specific functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms. The Naples research unit n. 6 will perform an association study between selected putative schizophrenia genes and specific psychometric, neurophysiological and neurocognitive schizophrenia endophenotypes; moreover, the research unit will search for de novo copy-number variations (CNV) as putative risk factors for schizophrenia or schizophrenia endophenotypes and for de novo protein-altering mutations that may contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia endophenotypes. The Naples research unit n. 5 will be responsible for defining a standardized protocol for the assessment of medical comorbidities in subjects with schizophrenia. All psychiatric research units will contribute to assess the role of factors related to the context in modulating the impact of variables related to the disease on real-life social functioning.Detailed DescriptionThe study will last 36 months. The questionnaire for the assessment of physical health and medical conditions risk factors, as well as the manual concerning the procedures for screening and assessment of medical comorbidity, will be developed during the first three months of the study. The recruitment and assessment of all subjects will be completed within the first semester of the third year. The analysis of data collected will be completed in the second semester of the third year. PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS In all subjects a blood sample of 20 ml will be withdrawn from a peripheral vein for genetic analyses. 1. Evaluation of aspects related to the disease. For all patients a clinical form will be filled in with data on age and type of disease onset, course of the disease and treatments. All available sources of information (patient, family, medical records and mental health workers) will be used to complete the form. The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) will be used to assess premorbid adjustment. It evaluates the achieved level of functioning before the onset of schizophrenia in four areas (social accessibility/isolation, peer relationships, ability to function outside the nuclear family, and capacity to form intimate social - sexual ties) during 4 periods of subject's life (childhood; early adolescence; late adolescence; adulthood), as well as the highest achieved global level of functioning. It comprises 26 items with a score ranging from 0 (healthiest end of the adjustment range) to 6 (indicating the least healthy end). General psychopathology and positive symptoms will be evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Negative symptoms will be assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). This scale includes 13 items and assesses 5 domains of negative symptoms: anhedonia, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia, as well as a control item, not included in the negative domains, ""Distress"". For all items of the 5 domains higher scores are associated with greater impairment/presence of symptoms, while for the item Distress the highest score is associated with reduction or absence of negative emotions. Depressive symptoms will be investigated using the Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS), a rating scale designed to assess the level of depression in people with schizophrenia. It includes 9 items (depression; hopelessness; self depreciation; guilty ideas of reference; pathological guilt; morning depression; early wakening; suicide; observed depression) with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The possible presence of extrapyramidal symptoms, whose assessment is required to exclude that the observed negative symptoms are secondary to them, will be verified by means of the St. Hans Rating Scale (SHRS), a multidimensional rating scale comprising four subscales: hyperkinesias, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia. Each subscale includes one or more items with a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 6 (severe). Neurocognitive functions will be evaluated by means of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The battery includes tests for the assessment of seven distinct cognitive domains: a) processing speed, b) attention/vigilance, c) working memory, d) verbal learning, e) visual learning, f) social cognition and g) reasoning and problem solving. The assessment of social cognition, partly included in the MCCB, will be completed using the Facial Emotion Identification Test and a theory of mind test The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). In the Facial Emotion Identification Test (FEIT), 55 faces are presented on a screen; the subject has to choose the facial emotion expressed by each face among 7 possibilities (anger, disgust, neutral, happiness, surprise, fear, sadness). The TASIT includes three sections: 1) Emotion Evaluation Test, that examines the ability to recognize basic emotions shown by other people, in which 28 vignettes are presented to the subject who has to choose the emotion expressed by a target actor from a multiple-choice array (surprise, happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety, disgust, neutral); 2) Test of Social Inference (Minimal), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences, specifically those involving the use of sarcasm; 15 vignettes are presented and the subject has to answer, for each vignette, four questions regarding, respectively, what one of the actors was ""doing"", what was he/she trying to ""say"", what was he/she ""thinking"" and what was he/she ""feeling""; 3) Test of Social Inference (Enriched), that evaluates the ability to perceive social inferences involving lying and using sarcasm; 16 vignettes are presented and the same questions of the second section are asked. 2. Assessment of personal resources The evaluation of physical health status will be carried out through the application of a standardized protocol developed by the unit N. 5 of Naples. The assessment of coping style will be made by means of the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory - Brief, including 28 items, divided into 14 scales: positive reframing, self-distraction, expression, use of instrumental support, active coping, denial, religion, humor, behavioral disengagement, use of emotional support, substance use, acceptance, planning, self-blame. The tool aims to capture a wide range of coping strategies in real life situations. The evaluation of self-esteem will be carried out using the Self-Esteem Rating Scale (SERS), which assesses different aspects of the self-esteem, such as feeling socially and self-competent, being worth of respect, feeling intelligent and able to solve problems. SERS is composed of 40 items, with ratings on a 7-point Likert scale. The recovery style will be evaluated using the Recovery Style Questionnaire. This self-administered instrument consists of 39 items that refer to the construct of continuity, ownership, responsibility, curiosity, education, help-seeking, blame, cause, optimism, impact, fear, liking and satisfaction. For each of them the person is categorized as sealer or integrator. Resilience will be evaluated through the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). The RSA is a scale that provides a multidimensional assessment of resilience general characteristics. It includes 33 items that examine intra-and inter-personal protective factors thought to facilitate adaptation when facing psychosocial adversity. Factor analysis showed six factors: a) personal competence, b) positive perception of the future, c) social competence, d), personal structure, and) family cohesion, f) social resources. The relationship with mental health services will be evaluated with the Service Engagement Scale (SES), which includes 16 items grouped into 4 subscales: a) availability, b) cooperation c) help seeking d) adherence to treatment. The person is given a score on a 4-point Likert scale. c) Evaluation of factors related to the context. For the evaluation of subject's family social - economic status the Social Economic Status will be used. The SES is based on: a) education and b) type of work. The educational level is measured on a 7-level scale (1=elementary school, 7=post-degree/specialization courses) and the type of work is rated on a 9-level scale (1=laborer, 9=high level managerial positions). To calculate the index the education level and the type of work of each parent is weighted. The amount of social policies expenditure and the unemployment rate in the geographical macro-area (Northeast, Northwest, Central, South and Islands) will be taken from the latest Italian National Institute of Statistic (ISTAT) tables. The availability of a disability pension, and access to family and social incentives will be investigated through a social - demographic questionnaire developed ad hoc with which data on sex, age, marital status, schooling, housing, and luxuries habits will be also collected. For the evaluation of the social network the Social Network Questionnaire (SNQ) will be used. It is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the structural and qualitative aspects of the social network. It includes 15 items, grouped into 4 factors: a) quality and frequency of social contacts; b) practical social support; c) emotional support, d) quality of an intimate relationship. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 ""never"" to 4 ""always"". The evaluation of the stigma associated with mental illness will be carried out using two instruments: the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), which will be administered to all patients and evaluates the experience of stigma and internalized self-rejection, and the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), which measures the perceived stigma, i.e., the attitudes of the general population with respect to mental disorders, which will be administered to all subjects. The ISMI is a scale that includes 29 items and 5 subscales for self-assessment of subjective experience of stigma. Each item is rated on a 4-level Likert scale, where higher scores indicate greater levels of internalized stigma. The PDD includes 12 items, each of whom is rated on a 5-level Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater stigma. d) Assessment of functional capacity and real-life functioning The functional capacity will be evaluated using the short version of the Performance-based Skills Assessment, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) , a performance-based instrument that investigates two areas: Financial Skills (counting money, counting change and paying bills) and Communication Skills (to dial a telephone number for emergency, for information, dial a telephone number from memory; to reschedule an appointment by telephone; to understand and to remember the instructions on a Medical Doctor Appointment Letter). Individual real-life functioning will be assessed by the Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF), a hybrid instrument that explores many aspects of functioning and is based on judgments by a caregiver/operator (or the direct observation) of behavior and functioning of patients. It consists of 43 items and includes the following domains: a) physical efficiency; b) skills in self-care; c) interpersonal relationships; d) social acceptability; e) community activities (e.g., shopping, using public transportation); f) working abilities. The scale that assesses ""Personal and Social Functioning"" (PSF) will be also used; it evaluates the areas of self-care, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSES WITH THE PHENOTYPES OF INTEREST The Naples research unit n. 6 will perform an association study between selected putative schizophrenia genes and specific psychometric, neurophysiological and neurocognitive schizophrenia endophenotypes; moreover, the research unit will search for de novo copy-number variations (CNV) as putative risk factors for schizophrenia or schizophrenia endophenotypes and for de novo protein-altering mutations that may contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia endophenotypes. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA To identify the factors that affect most real-life functioning of people diagnosed with schizophrenia multiple regression statistical models will be used. Real-life functioning and functional capacity indices will be defined as dependent variables. The three blocks of variables, i.e. disease-related variable, personal resources and context-related variables, will be the independent variables or predictors. structural equation model (SEM), that according to some authors is robust against the problem of multicollinearity occurring in a regression model when there is a linear correlation among the independent variables, will be used. This analysis allows to draw assumptions on the causality between the variables and, based on path analysis o identify potential factors mediating and moderating the relationships between dependent and independent variables. The explored models will be subsequently tested with confirmatory analyses. Estimated sample size for this analysis is of at least 5 independent observations for each index in the model. Therefore, by including in the model: 3 demographic indices (age, sex and education), 15 variables related to the disease (PANSS-general and PANSS-positive subscale scores, 2 negative symptom domains derived from BNSS, 6 cognitive domains from the MCCB, 4 indices of social cognition, derived from the specific section of the MCCB, TASIT and FEIT, the total score for depression on the Calgary scale), 36 indices related to the personal resources (6 factors of Resilience, 14 Coping factors, 13 Recovery styles factors, 1 score for Self-Esteem, 1 index of relationship with mental health services, 1 physical health index) and 10 related to the context (1 index of economic status, 5 indices of financial opportunities and work/family and social incentives, 2 stigma indices, 2 social network factors), for a total of 64 indices, it is estimated that an appropriate sample of patients will be 64x5=320 subjects. The effects of dichotomous variables (eg, gender) and ordinal (eg, social class) will be assessed with one- or multiple-way analyses of variance. The analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS).",2014,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2758,,"",""
Neurodevelopmental disabilities in children with intermediate and premutation range fragile X cytosine-guanine-guanine expansions,"Renda, M.M.; Voigt, R.G.; Babovic-Vuksanovic, D.; Highsmith, W.E.; Vinson, S.S.; Sadowski, C.M.; Hagerman, R.J.","To determine the range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses associated with intermediate (45-54 repeats) and premutation (55-200 repeats) range cytosine-guanine-guanine fragile X expansions, the medical records of children with intermediate or premutation range expansions were retrospectively reviewed, and all neurodevelopmental diagnoses were abstracted. Twenty-nine children (9 female, 20 male; age, 13 months to 17 years) with intermediate (n = 25) or premutation (n = 4) range expansions were identified with neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including global developmental delay/intellectual disability (n = 15), language and learning disorders (n = 9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 5), epilepsy (n = 5), and motor disorders (n = 12), including 2 boys younger than 4 years of age with tremor and ataxia.

Polygenic scores predict alcohol problems in an independent sample and show moderation by the environment,"Salvatore, J.E.; Aliev, F.; Edwards, A.C.; Evans, D.M.; Macleod, J.; Hickman, M.; Lewis, G.; Kendler, K.S.; Loukola, A.; Korhonen, T.; Latvala, A.; Rose, R.J.; Kaprio, J.; Dick, D.M.","Alcohol problems represent a classic example of a complex behavioral outcome that is likely influenced by many genes of small effect. A polygenic approach, which examines aggregate measured genetic effects, can have predictive power in cases where individual genes or genetic variants do not. In the current study, we first tested whether polygenic risk for alcohol problems-derived from genome-wide association estimates of an alcohol problems factor score from the age 18 assessment of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 4304 individuals of European descent; 57% female)-predicted alcohol problems earlier in development (age 14) in an independent sample (FinnTwin12; n = 1162; 53% female). We then tested whether environmental factors (parental knowledge and peer deviance) moderated polygenic risk to predict alcohol problems in the FinnTwin12 sample. We found evidence for both polygenic association and for additive polygene-environment interaction. Higher polygenic scores predicted a greater number of alcohol problems (range of Pearson partial correlations 0.07-0.08, all p-values ≤ 0.01). Moreover, genetic influences were significantly more pronounced under conditions of low parental knowledge or high peer deviance (unstandardized regression coefficients (b), p-values (p), and percent of variance (R2) accounted for by interaction terms: b = 1.54, p = 0.02, R2 = 0.33%; b = 0.94, p = 0.04, R = 0.30%, respectively). Supplementary set-based analyses indicated that the individual top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contributing to the polygenic scores were not individually enriched for gene-environment interaction. Although the magnitude of the observed effects are small, this study illustrates the usefulness of polygenic approaches for understanding the pathways by which measured genetic predispositions come together with environmental factors to predict complex behavioral outcomes. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2014,,Genes,5,2,330-346,,10.3390/genes5020330,,#2764,Salvatore 2014,"",""

Studies have found that fetuses and infants are more sensitive than adults to environmental toxicants and that prenatal exposure to low levels of OPs has been associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Like Phenotypes (ADHD-LP). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an enzyme involved in detoxifying some OPs and its polymorphisms influence enzyme activity and quantity. The objective of this study was to examine whether maternal and/or child PON1 genotypes (PON1R192Q and PON1L55M) were associated with ADHD-LP in a Mexico City, Mexico birth cohort. PON1R192Q and PON1L55M genotypes in mothers (PON1R192Q: N=531; PON1L55M: N=458) and children (PON1R192Q: N=532; PON1L55M: N=478) from blood DNA were determined. We assessed ADHD-LP for children between the ages of 6 and 13 using Conners[U+05F3] Parent Rating Scales-Revised (CRS-R), Conners[U+05F3] Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and the parent scores for Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC2). Multivariable linear regression models were used to test relationships between ADHD-LP and PON1 polymorphisms. In these models, significant associations were observed with maternal genotypes but not with the child genotypes. A higher DSM IV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity score (β=3.27 points; 95% CI (0.89, 5.65)) and a 2.17 higher score in child DSM IV Total (95% CI (0.05, 4.29)) were observed for maternal PON155MM in comparison to PON155LM+LL. The childattention problems score was 2.27 points higher (95% CI (0.002, 4.53) for maternal PON1192QQ in comparison to PON1192QR+RR.

Understanding gender variance in children and adolescents,"Simons, L.K.; Leibowitz, S.F.; Hidalgo, M.A.","Gender variance is an umbrella term used to describe gender identity, expression, or behavior that falls outside of culturally defined norms associated with a specific gender. In recent years, growing media coverage has heightened public awareness about gender variance in childhood and adolescence, and an increasing number of referrals to clinics specializing in care for gender-variant youth have been reported in the United States. Gender-variant expression, behavior, and identity may present in childhood and adolescence in a number of ways, and youth with gender variance have unique health needs. For those experiencing gender dysphoria, or distress encountered by the discordance between biological sex and gender identity, puberty is often an exceptionally challenging time. Pediatric primary care providers may be families' first resource for education and support, and they play a critical role in supporting the health of youth with gender variance by screening for psychosocial problems and health risks, referring for genderspecific mental health and medical care, and providing ongoing advocacy and support. © SLACK Incorporated.",2014,,Pediatric Annals,43,6,e126-e131,,10.3928/00904481-20140522-07,,#2769,Simons 2014,"",""
Parent training: Equivalent improvement in externalizing behavior for children with and without familial risk,"Presnall, N.; Webster-Stratton, C.H.; Constantino, J.N.","Objective The Incredible Years Series intervention has demonstrated efficacy for decreasing conduct disorder (CD) symptomatology in clinically affected youth in multiple randomized controlled trials. Because children with family psychiatric histories of antisocial behavior are at markedly increased risk for enduring symptoms of antisocial behavior (compared with their counterparts with a negative family history), the authors examined whether intervention effects across studies would prevail in that subgroup or would be relatively restricted to children without genetic risk. Method A reanalysis was conducted of 5 randomized controlled trials of Incredible Years involving 280 clinically affected children 3 to 8 years of age for whom a family psychiatric history of externalizing behavior in first- and second-degree relatives was ascertained from at least 1 parent. Results Incredible Years equally benefitted children with CD with and without family psychiatric histories of externalizing behavior. Family psychiatric history of externalizing behavior and parental depressive symptomatology predicted greater severity of CD symptomatology at baseline. Conclusion The beneficial effects of IY are evident in children with CD, irrespective of whether their conditions are more or less attributable to inherited susceptibility to enduring antisocial syndromes. A next phase of research should address whether earlier implementation of group-based education for parents of young children at increased familial risk for antisocial behavior syndromes - before the development of disruptive patterns of behavior - would result in even more pronounced effects and thereby constitute a cost-effective, targeted, preventive intervention for CD. © 2014 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.",2014,,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,53,8,859-868,,10.1016/j.jaac.2014.04.024,,#2770,Presnall 2014,"",""
GABA receptors genes polymorphisms and alcohol dependence: No evidence of an association in an Italian male population,"Terranova, C.; Tucci, M.; Di Pietra, L.; Ferrara, S.D.","Objective: The genes encoding for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A and B receptors may be considered as candidates for alcoholism; genetic alterations at this level may produce structural and functional diversity and thus play a role in the response to alcohol addiction treatment. To investigate these aspects further, we conducted a preliminary genetic association study on a population of Italian male alcohol addicts, focusing on GABA A and B receptors. Methods: A total of 186 alcohol-dependent subjects (in the first phase 139, then 47 more samples) and 182 controls were genotyped for 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding the alpha-1 subunit of GABA A receptor (GABRA1) and subunits 1 and 2 of GABA B receptor (GABBR1 and GABBR2). The chi-squared test for allele and genotype distributions and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis of both subjects and controls were performed. Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Results: Preliminary results comparing 139 alcohol-dependent subjects and 182 controls showed differences in genotype distribution in the former for SNP rs29253, located in the intron region of the GABBR1 gene. In order to clarify the meaning of this association, 47 more samples from alcohol-dependent subjects were tested for this SNP only: the previously found association was not confirmed. Conclusion: The lack of significant differences between the two groups does not provide evidence that GABRA 1 and GABBR1 and 2 genes are candidates for alcoholism in this population. Further studies with larger samples are needed, together with investigation of other components of the GABA pathway.

"Cannabis, the pregnant woman and her child: Weeding out the myths","Jaques, S.C.; Kingsbury, A.; Henshcke, P.; Chomchai, C.; Clews, S.; Falconer, J.; Abdel-Latif, M.E.; Feller, J.M.; Oei, J.L.","To review and summarise the literature reporting on cannabis use within western communities with specific reference to patterns of use, the pharmacology of its major psychoactive compounds, including placental and fetal transfer, and the impact of maternal cannabis use on pregnancy, the newborn infant and the developing child. Review of published articles, governmental guidelines and data and book chapters. Although cannabis is one of the most widely used illegal drugs, there is limited data about the prevalence of cannabis use in pregnant women, and it is likely that reported rates of exposure are significantly underestimated. With much of the available literature focusing on the impact of other illicit drugs such as opioids and stimulants, the effects of cannabis use in pregnancy on the developing fetus remain uncertain. Current evidence indicates that cannabis use both during pregnancy and lactation, may adversely affect neurodevelopment, especially during periods of critical brain growth both in the developing fetal brain and during adolescent maturation, with impacts on neuropsychiatric, behavioural and executive functioning. These reported effects may influence future adult productivity and lifetime outcomes. Despite the widespread use of cannabis by young women, there is limited information available about the impact perinatal cannabis use on the developing fetus and child, particularly the effects of cannabis use while breast feeding. Women who are using cannabis while pregnant and breast feeding should be advised of what is known about the potential adverse effects on fetal growth and development and encouraged to either stop using or decrease their use.

Reducing substance use during adolescence: A translational framework for prevention,"Stanis, J.J.; Andersen, S.L.","Rationale: Most substance use is initiated during adolescence when substantial development of relevant brain circuitry is still rapidly maturing. Developmental differences in reward processing, behavioral flexibility, and self-regulation lead to changes in resilience or vulnerability to drugs of abuse depending on exposure to risk factors. Intervention and prevention approaches to reducing addiction in teens may be able to capitalize on malleable brain systems in a predictable manner. Objective: This review will highlight what is known about how factors that increase vulnerability to addiction, including developmental stage, exposure to early life adversity (ranging from abuse, neglect, and bullying), drug exposure, and genetic predisposition, impact the development of relevant systems. Results and conclusions: Appropriate, early intervention may restore the normal course of an abnormal trajectory and reduce the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder (SUD) later in life. A considerable amount is known about the functional neuroanatomy and/or pharmacology of risky behaviors based on clinical and preclinical studies, but relatively little has been directly translated to reduce their impact on addiction in high-risk children or teenagers. An opportunity exists to effectively intervene before adolescence when substance use is likely to emerge. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2014,,Psychopharmacology,231,8,1437-1453,,10.1007/s00213-013-3393-1,,#2777,Stanis 2014,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Anxiety of children and adolescents who stutter: A review,"Smith, K.A.; Iverach, L.; O'Brian, S.; Kefalianos, E.; Reilly, S.","Purpose: Adults who stutter have heightened rates of anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder, compared with non-stuttering controls. However, the timing of anxiety onset and its development in relation to stuttering is poorly understood. Identifying the typical age of anxiety onset in stuttering has significant clinical implications and is crucial for the management of both disorders across the lifespan. The present review aims to determine the scope of the research pertaining to this topic, identify trends in findings, and delineate timing of anxiety onset in stuttering. Methods: We examine putative risk factors of anxiety present for children and adolescents who stutter, and provide a review of the research evidence relating to anxiety for this population. Results: Young people who stutter can experience negative social consequences and negative attitudes towards communication, which is hypothesised to place them at increased risk of developing anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety of young people who stutter, and the timing of anxiety onset in stuttering could not be determined. This was due to methodological limitations in the reviewed research such as small participant numbers, and the use of measures that lack sensitivity to identify anxiety in the targeted population. Conclusions: In sum, the evidence suggests that anxiety in stuttering might increase over time until it exceeds normal limits in adolescence and adulthood. The clinical implications of these findings, and recommendations for future research, are discussed.Educational Objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) discuss contemporary thinking on the role of anxiety in stuttering and reasons for this view; (b) describe risk factors for the development of anxiety in stuttering, experienced by children and adolescents who stutter (c) outline trends in current research on anxiety and children and adolescents with stuttering; and (d) summarise rationales behind recommendations for future research in this area. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",2014,,Journal of Fluency Disorders,40,"(Smith K.A., kylie.smith@mcri.edu.au; Kefalianos E.; Reilly S.)

Psychiatric aspects of bariatric surgery,"Yen, Y.-C.; Huang, C.-K.; Tai, C.-M.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bariatric surgery has been consistently shown to be effective in long-term marked weight loss and in bringing significant improvement to medical comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome. Empirical data suggest a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders among bariatric surgery candidates. In this review, we focus on the studies published recently with a high impact on our understanding of the role of psychiatry in bariatric surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: This article reviews the specific psychopathologies before surgery, changes in psychopathologies after surgery, suicide risk related to bariatric surgery, factors associated with weight loss, and recommendations for presurgical and postsurgical assessment and management. Research indicates a decrease in certain psychiatric symptoms after weight loss with bariatric surgery. However, the risk of suicide and unsuccessful weight loss in some bariatric surgery patients make monitoring following surgery as important as careful assessment and management before surgery. Specific considerations for youth and older populations and future potential research foci are discussed. SUMMARY: Recent publications suggest new directions for psychiatric evaluation and interventions for bariatric surgery patients.

Using data from the borderline subscale of the Personality Assessment Inventory Borderline Features Scale (PAI-BOR) collected in two Dutch cohorts (N=7125), the Netherlands Twin Register and The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, we show that heritability of the PAI-BOR total score using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) is estimated at 23%, and that the genetic variance is substantially higher in affect instability items compared with the other three subscales of the PAI-BOR (42.7% vs non-significant estimates for self-harm, negative relations and identity problems). We present results from a first genome-wide association study of BP features, which shows a promising signal on chromosome 5 corresponding to SERINC5, a protein involved in myelination. Reduced myelination has been suggested as possibly having a role in the development of psychiatric disorders characterized by lack of social interaction. The signal was confirmed in a third independent Dutch cohort drawn from the Erasmus Rucphen Family study (N=1301). Our analyses were complemented by investigating the heterogeneity that was implied by the differences in genetic variance components in the four subscales of the PAI-BOR. These analyses show that the association of SNPs tagging SERINC5 differs substantially across the 24 items of the PAI-BOR. Further, using reverse regression we showed that the effects were present only in subjects with higher scores on the PAI-BOR. Taken together, these results suggest that future genome-wide analyses can benefit substantially by taking into account the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of BP features.",2014,,Molecular Psychiatry,19,8,923-929,,10.1038/mp.2013.109,,#2789,Lubke 2014,"",""
Larger amygdala volume in first-degree relatives of patients with major depression,"Romanczuk-Seiferth, N.","OBJECTIVE: Although a heritable contribution to risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) has been established and neural alterations in patients have been identified through neuroimaging, it is unclear which brain abnormalities are related to genetic risk. Studies on brain structure of high-risk subjects - such as individuals carrying a familial liability for the development of MDD - can provide information on the potential usefulness of these measures as intermediate phenotypes of MDD.METHODS: 63 healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD and 63 healthy controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Regional gray matter volumes were analyzed via voxel-based morphometry (VBM).RESULTS: Whole-brain analysis revealed significantly larger gray matter volume in the bilateral amygdala in first-degree relatives of patients with MDD. Furthermore, relatives showed significantly larger gray matter volume in anatomical structures found relevant to MDD in previous literature, specifically in the bilateral hippocampus and amygdala as well as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Bilateral DLPFC volume correlated positively with the experience of negative affect.CONCLUSIONS: Larger gray matter volume in healthy relatives of MDD patients point to a possible vulnerability mechanism in MDD etiology and therefore extend knowledge in the field of high-risk approaches in MDD.",2014,,NeuroImage.

The relation of parental alcoholism to the prevalence of suicide attempts among hospitalized psychiatric adolescents,"Krajewska, K.; Florkowski, A.; Gmitrowicz, A.","Suicide is the third cause of death at the age group 10-19 in the world. There are inter multiple risk factors of suicidal behaviours. In the case of children of alcoholics the increased number of suicide attempts is explained by genetic predisposition and accumulation of environmental risk factors. The aim of this study is to check whether parental alcoholism is associated with the number and repetition of suicide attempts and the age at which the first suicide attempt occurred among hospitalized psychiatric adolescents. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis - based on medical documentation - of 119 patients aged 13-18, treated during 2013-2014 at the Department of Adolescent Psychiatry in Łódź for: schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders, mood disorders, neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, behavioural and emotional disorders according to ICD-10. The exclusion criteria were other psychiatric diagnoses, incomplete family history and lack of information about intended self-harm behaviours. The patients were selected at random. The number and repetition of suicide attempts, the age at which the first suicide attempt occurred, parental alcoholism and family history of suicidal behaviours were examined. Analyses were carried out using Statistica 9.1. Results: Parental alcoholism did not statistically significantly affect (p > 0.05) the prevalence or repetition of suicide attempts among psychiatrically treated adolescents. The first suicide attempts were not made by adolescents - also considering the gender, diagnosis, and familial suicidal behaviours. Conclusions: In almost half of the examined psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents at least one parent met the parental alcoholism criteria. Suicide attempts occurred in over 50% of the examined patients, with somewhat higher incidence in girls whose parents met the parental alcoholism criteria, as compared to those without parental alcoholism history. No significant correlation was found between parental alcoholism and the incidence of offspring's suicide attempts, repetition of suicide attempts, and the age at which suicide attempt is made. The research on the correlation between the prevalence of suicide attempts among psychiatrically treated adolescents and parental alcoholism should also involve appraisal of the family functioning.",2014,,Psychiatria i Psychologia Kliniczna,14,3,196-201,,10.15557/PiPK.2014.0028,,#2794,Krajewska 2014,"",""

Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders of childhood,"Tamara, P.","Tourettte syndrome (TS) is a common, childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorder consisting of multiple motor and one or more vocal tics which persist for more than 1 year. Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses are frequent in this patient population, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Tics can be simple or complex, and have a tendency to change over time. Tics are preceded by a premonitory sensation, wax and wane in frequency, and are often exacerbated by stress or excitement. Tic severity usually peaks in childhood, and improves in early adulthood. TS is a highly heritable disorder with a polygenic inheritance. The fundamental pathophysiology of TS is not known, although existing evidence suggests that it involves dysfunction of the basal ganglia and frontal cortical circuits, as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission. Treatment of TS involves consideration of symptom severity and comorbidity. In general, comorbid ADHD and OCD lead to greater disability in these patients, and therefore are the initial treatment priority. As treatment for tics does not alter the natural history of the disorder, it is only recommended if the tics are causing disability. Effective treatments to suppress tics include α-adrenergic agonists and antipsychotic medications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,,Handbook of Clinical Neurology,112,"(Tamara P., tmprings@ucalgary.ca) Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Canada",853-856,,10.1016/B978-0-444-52910-7.00005-2,,#2805,Tamara 2013,"",""

The goal of the present study was to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in extended families from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism to identify novel genes affecting risk for alcohol dependence (AD). To maximize the power of the extended family design, we used a quantitative endophenotype, measured in all individuals: number of alcohol-dependence symptoms endorsed (symptom count (SC)). Secondary analyses were performed to determine if the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SC were also associated with the dichotomous phenotype, DSM-IV AD. This family-based GWAS identified SNPs in C15orf53 that are strongly associated with DSM-IV alcohol-dependence symptom counts (P=4.5 × 10 -8, inflation-corrected P=9.4 × 10 -7).

Changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety ëfrom middle adolescence to early adulthood,"Garcia, S.E.; Tully, E.C.; Tarantino, N.; South, S.; Jacono, W.G.; McGue, M.","Background: Middle adolescence to early adulthood is an important developmental period for the emergence of anxiety. Genetically-influenced stable traits are thought to underlie internalizing psychopathology throughout development, but no studies have examined changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety during this period. Method: A longitudinal twin study design was used to study same-sex twin pairs (485 monozygotic pairs, 271 dizygotic pairs) at three ages, 14, 18, and 21 years, to examine developmental shifts in genetic and environmental effects on trait anxiety. Results: The heritability of trait anxiety increased with age, particularly between ages 14 and 18, no significant new genetic influences emerged after age 14, and the genetic influences were highly correlated across the three ages, supporting developmentally stable genetic risk factors. The environmental effects shared by members of a family decreased in influence across adolescence, while the influence of environmental effects unique to each individual twin remained relatively stable over the course of development and were largely age-specific. Limitations: The twin study design does not inform about specific genes and environmental risk factors. Conclusions: Genetic influences increased in importance from middle to late adolescence but common genetic factors influenced trait anxiety across the three ages. Shared environmental influences decreased in importance and demonstrated negligible influence by late adolescenceearly adulthood. Nonshared environmental effects were almost entirely age-specific. These findings support the importance of developmentally-sensitive interventions that target shared environmental factors prior to middle adolescence and shifting non-shared environmental risks at each age. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We studied genetic variability in the DHEA-producing enzyme CYP17A1 in relation to anorexia nervosa (AN) susceptibility and AN-related co-morbidities. We performed analysis of 100 Israeli AN family trios accounting for CYP17A1 haplotypes characteristic of populations of European origin and studied genotype-phenotype relationships using correlation analyses and transmission disequilibrium test. Although our analysis revealed no evidence of association between CYP17A1 and AN per se, it revealed an association between specific CYP17A1 haplotypes and AN co-morbidity, specifically anxiety. We found that a common CYP17A1 haplotype (H1) was associated with higher anxiety in AN patients (Clinical Global Impression; CGI-anxiety ≥4). Moreover, H1 homozygotes were at higher risk for expressing high CGI-anxiety levels (OR = 3.7), and H1 was preferentially transmitted to AN patients with high CGI-anxiety levels (P = 0. 037). We suggest that CYP17A1 H1 haplotype may contribute to genetic predisposition to higher CGI-anxiety levels in AN patients and that this predisposition may be mediated by reduced CYP17A1 enzymatic activity and corresponding lower DHEA production. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",2013,,Archives of Women's Mental Health,16,5,423-428,,10.1007/s00737-013-0363-x,,#2814,Czerniak 2013,"",""

"Modeling the association between sexual maturation, transmissible risk, and peer relationships during childhood and adolescence on development of substance use disorder in young adulthood","Horner, M.S.; Tarter, R.; Kirisci, L.; Clark, D.B.","Background This prospective study investigated pubertal timing and transmissible risk in relation to affiliation with deviant peers on the development of substance use disorder (SUD). Method Participants were boys (N = 500) ascertained through proband fathers with (N = 250), and without (N = 250) DSM-III-R lifetime diagnosis of SUD who were prospectively tracked from age 10-12 to 22. Transmissible liability index (TLI), Tanner stage, peer delinquency, and substance use were measured at ages 10-12 and 16. SUD diagnosis during early adulthood was determined. Results Structural equation modeling revealed two pathways in which transmissible risk and sexual maturation influenced development of SUD. In the first pathway, transmissible risk was correlated with and prospectively predicted affiliation with deviant peers and substance use presaging SUD. In the second pathway, advanced sexual maturation positively predicted affiliation with deviant peers and substance use, which in turn predicted SUD. However, transmissible risk was not associated with pubertal development. Conclusion These findings indicate that advanced sexual maturation and transmissible risk constitute unrelated facets of SUD liability; however, both factors bias development toward SUD via affiliation with deviant peers. Scientific Significance Youth with advanced sexual maturation and/or transmissible risk for SUD are at higher risk for developing SUD. Additional research is needed to determine if addressing these risk factors will contribute to advancements in SUD prevention.

"Psychological differences between early- and late-onset psoriasis: A study of personality traits, anxiety and depression in psoriasis","Remröd, C.; Sjöström, K.; Svensson, A.","Background Onset of psoriasis may occur at any age. Early negative experiences often influence personality development, and may lead to physical disease, anxiety and depression in adulthood. Knowledge about onset of psoriasis and psychopathology is limited. Objectives To examine whether patients with early-onset psoriasis differ psychologically from patients with late-onset psoriasis, regarding personality traits, anxiety and depression. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 101 consecutively recruited outpatients with psoriasis. A psychosocial interview was performed followed by self-assessment of validated questionnaires: Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Psoriasis severity was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Results Patients with early-onset psoriasis (age < 20 years) were significantly more anxious and depressed than patients with late-onset psoriasis. In multiple linear regression models, younger age at onset of psoriasis was a significant determinant of higher scores of four personality traits: SSP-embitterment, -trait irritability, -mistrust and -verbal trait aggression. Conclusions Our results indicate that early detection of psychological vulnerability when treating children and adolescents with psoriasis seems to be of great importance. Traits of psychological vulnerability and pessimistic personality traits were found to be significantly associated with the early onset of psoriasis, but not with disease duration in this study. These traits may be seen as a consequence of psoriasis, and/or as individual traits modulating and impairing clinical course and efforts to cope with psoriasis. What's already known about this topic? Psoriasis is often associated with psychological distress, both as a consequence of the disease and as a triggering and aggravating factor for onset and course. Early-onset psoriasis has been associated with greater genetic susceptibility, more severe course and greater psychosocial impact. Early negative experiences are known to influence personality development, and may lead to physical disease, anxiety and depression into adulthood. What does this study add? Early detection of psychological vulnerability in younger patients with psoriasis seems to be of great clinical importance. Younger age at onset of psoriasis, but not disease duration, was significantly associated with psychological traits of anxiety, embitterment, mistrust, irritability and verbal aggressiveness.

Genome-wide association analyses were performed using PLINK. SNP-heritability and SNP-genetic correlations with ADHD in Caucasians were estimated with genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA). Pathway analyses were performed using the Interval enRICHment Test (INRICH), the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE), and the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT).

Key findings: Eight patients (38%) carried rare CNVs that might contribute to their phenotype. The pathogenicity could be questioned in some of them, but in four patients (19%) a causative role was considered highly probable. Three had CNVs and clinical features consistent with known genetic syndromes: 22q13.3 deletion, 2q23.1 deletion, and MECP2 duplication. Significance: There is a high frequency of rare CNVs in adult patients with LGS-like epilepsy.

Genes of experience: Explaining the heritability of putative environmental variables through their association with behavioural and emotional traits,"McAdams, T.A.; Gregory, A.M.; Eley, T.C.","An increasing body of evidence shows that many 'environmental' measures are heritable, indicating genetic involvement in environmental exposure (or gene-environment correlation).

Through multivariate genetic analysis of a sample of adolescent twins from the UK we show that the heritability of these putative environmental measures can be explained via their association with five behavioural phenotypes: oppositionality, delinquency, physical aggression, depression and anxiety. This is consistent with the notion that being genetically susceptible to certain behavioural difficulties could lead to exposure to certain life events, and this may account for the reported heritability of 'environmental' measures.

Effects of Heavy Adolescent Cannabis Use on Brain Morphology in Aging,"","Brief SummaryMarijuana (Cannabis sativa) is the most widely used illicit drug worldwide, with 17.4 million Americans reporting past month use in 2010 and 4.6 million meeting criteria for dependence, underscoring the public health importance of understanding the biological implications of use. How heavy cannabis use affects brain structure and cognitive performance in late life is unknown. The ongoing maturation in the adolescent brain, including the developmental circuitry underlying memory performance and executive control puts the adolescent brain at high risk for detrimental effects of heavy cannabis use. With the aging of the 'baby boomer' generation, many people who used cannabis heavily as adolescents are now entering their senior years when age-related cognitive decline may begin. Cannabis use doubled in less than a decade during the 1970's when 38% of those surveyed in the U.S. Survey on Drug Abuse reported using cannabis and 12% of those users reported using cannabis more than 20 times a month. Understanding how heavy, early cannabis use may affect neurobiological and cognitive outcomes is of high importance for this aging population, which is already at risk for memory and cognitive deficits in aging. Because cannabis use appears to have a primary effect within the hippocampus, the main structure for memory and the structure affected most by age-related memory impairments and pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease, we expect that the effects of chronic cannabis use may be greatest during aging. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the long-term effects of adolescent cannabis use on hippocampal morphology and cognitive performance in an aging population. Investigators will investigate hippocampal integrity and cognitive performance using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological testing in an aging population of subjects (55-70 years old) who used cannabis more than 20 times a month for at least a year during adolescence. Investigators will compare data collected from heavy cannabis users to subjects who did not use cannabis but are matched for age, gender, education, light tobacco and light alcohol use. Finally, because family history and genetic risk are known to accelerate hippocampal morphology and memory decline in aging, the investigators will investigate whether possession of the APOE ε4 variant in heavy cannabis users is synergistically related to thinner hippocampal cortex and white matter deficits.",2013,,clinicaltrials.gov,,,,,,,#2838,,"",""
Attentional threat avoidance and familial risk are independently associated with childhood anxiety disorders.,"Brown, H.M.; McAdams, T.A.; Lester, K.J.; Goodman, R.; Clark, D.M.; Eley, T.C.","Twin studies in children reveal that familial aggregation of anxiety disorders is due to both genetic and environmental factors. Cognitive biases for threat information are considered a robust characteristic of childhood anxiety. However, little is known regarding the underlying aetiology of such biases and their role in anxiety disorders. A face version of the dot-probe task measuring attentional biases for negative (anger, fear, sad, disgust) and positive (happy) facial expressions was completed by 600, 8-year-old twins; the largest study of its kind. Twin correlations for attentional bias scores were compared to estimate genetic and environmental effects. Parent-report diagnostic interviews identified children with an anxiety disorder. Indices of inferred genetic and familial risk for anxiety disorders were created for each child. Data were analysed using a series of logistic regressions. Anxious children showed greater attentional avoidance of negative faces than nonanxious children; t (548) = 2.55, p < .05. Attentional avoidance was not under genetic or shared environmental influence. Risk for anxiety disorders was predicted by familial factors. Both attentional avoidance and inferred familial risk were significant but independent predictors of anxiety disorders (ORs = .65 and 3.64, respectively). Anxiety-related attentional biases and familial risk play important but independent roles in childhood anxiety disorders. If replicated, these findings indicate that links between genetic risk and anxiety disorders lie outside the domain of attentional processes. © 2012 The Authors.

Endocannabinoid metabolism in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia,"Volk, D.W.; Siegel, B.I.; Verrico, C.D.; Lewis, D.A.","Adolescent cannabis use is associated with greater relative risk, increased symptom severity, and earlier age of onset of schizophrenia. We investigated whether this interaction may be partly attributable to disease-related disturbances in metabolism of the major cortical endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Transcript levels for the recently discovered 2-AG metabolizing enzyme, α-β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6), were assessed using quantitative PCR in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia and healthy subjects (n = 84) and antipsychotic- or tetrahydrocannabinol-exposed monkeys. ABHD6 mRNA levels were elevated in schizophrenia subjects who were younger and had a shorter illness duration but not in antipsychotic- or tetrahydrocannabinol-exposed monkeys. Higher ABHD6 mRNA levels may increase 2-AG metabolism which may influence susceptibility to cannabis in the earlier stages of schizophrenia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,,Schizophrenia Research,147,1,53-57,,10.1016/j.schres.2013.02.038,,#2841,Volk 2013,"",""
Parental depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and attention problems in children: a cross-cohort consistency study.,"Van Batenburg-Eddes, T.; Brion, M.J.; Henrichs, J.; Jaddoe, V.W.; Hofman, A.; Verhulst, F.C.; Lawlor, D.A.; Davey Smith, G.; Tiemeier, H.","Maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy have been associated with offspring-attention deficit problems. We explored possible intrauterine effects by comparing maternal and paternal symptoms during pregnancy, by investigating cross-cohort consistency, and by investigating whether parental symptoms in early childhood may explain any observed intrauterine effect. This study was conducted in two cohorts (Generation R, n = 2,280 and ALSPAC, n = 3,442). Pregnant women and their partners completed questionnaires to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety. Child attention problems were measured in Generation R at age 3 with the Child Behavior Checklist, and in ALSPAC at age 4 with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In both cohorts, antenatal maternal symptoms of depression (Generation R: OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.43; ALSPAC: OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.19-1.48) and anxiety (Generation R: OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.46; ALSPAC: OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19-1.47) were associated with a higher risk of child attention problems. In ALSPAC, paternal depression was also associated with a higher risk of child attention problems (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24). After adjusting for maternal symptoms after giving birth, antenatal maternal depression and anxiety were no longer associated with child attention problems in Generation R. Moreover, there was little statistical evidence that antenatal maternal and paternal depression and anxiety had a substantially different effect on attention problems of the child. The apparent intrauterine effect of maternal depression and anxiety on offspring-behavioural problems may be partly explained by residual confounding. There was little evidence of a difference between the strength of associations of maternal and paternal symptoms during pregnancy with offspring-attention problems. That maternal symptoms after childbirth were also associated with offspring-behavioural problems may indicate a contribution of genetic influences to the association. © 2012 The Authors.

Material and methods: The present study is part of the European Prediction of Psychosis Study (EPOS). Data were collected from 245 help-seeking individuals from six European centers (age 16-35) who met criteria for ultra-high risk of psychosis criteria. This paper seeks to investigate self-reported physical ill health and its associations with psychiatric symptoms and disorders, risk factors, and onset of psychosis during 48 months of follow-up.

Reducing the burden of depression in youth: What are the implications of neuroscience and genetics on policies and programs?,"Patel, V.","Mood disorders are a leading cause of the burden of disease in youth. Three critical lessons emerge from the reviews in this issue that are relevant to our understanding of these common mental disorders: first, that the brain is in a highly dynamic stage of its development during youth; second, that environmental factors interact with genetic factors to influence the probability of risk behaviors and dysphoric states; and third, that shared developmental and genetic factors may account for the bulk of emotional and behavioral outcomes in youth, and that environmental influences may affect the specific expression of the phenotypes associated with these pathways. Although this evidence does not immediately indicate the potential for new interventions, it is consistent with current policy and practice recommendations. Interventions should focus on both improving the early detection and management of depressive disorders as well as preventive strategies that aim to train children and youth to improve cognitive control and manage stress more effectively. Limiting access to harmful risk-taking situations and providing opportunities to engage are less harmful, but equally exciting, alternatives in a pragmatic universal prevention policy option. Key research priorities and paradigms emerge from this evidence, particularly in the context of the grand challenges in global mental health. © 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Imaging gene and environmental effects on cerebellum in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and typical development,"De Zeeuw, P.; Van Belle, J.; Van Dijk, S.; Weusten, J.; Koeleman, B.; Janson, E.; Van Engeland, H.; Durston, S.","This study investigates the effects of XKR4, a recently identified candidate gene for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), birth weight, and their interaction on brain volume in ADHD. XKR4 is expressed in cerebellum and low birth weight has been associated both with changes in cerebellum and with ADHD, probably due to its relation with prenatal adversity. Anatomical MRI scans were acquired in 58 children with ADHD and 64 typically developing controls and processed to obtain volumes of cerebrum, cerebellum and gray and white matter in each structure. DNA was collected from saliva. Analyses including data on birth weight were conducted in a subset of 37 children with ADHD and 51 controls where these data were retrospectively collected using questionnaires. There was an interaction between genotype and birth weight for cerebellum gray matter volume (p =.020). The combination of homozygosity for the G-allele (the allele previously found to be overtransmitted in ADHD) and higher birth weight was associated with smaller volume. Furthermore, birth weight was positively associated with cerebellar white matter volume in controls, but not ADHD (interaction: p =.021). The interaction of genotype with birth weight affecting cerebellum gray matter is consistent with models that emphasize increased influence of genetic risk-factors in an otherwise favorable prenatal environment. The absence of an association between birth weight and cerebellum white matter volume in ADHD suggests that other genetic or environmental effects may be at play, unrelated to XKR4. These results underscore the importance of considering environmental effects in imaging genetics studies. © 2012 The Authors.",2013,,NeuroImage: Clinical,2,1,103-110,,10.1016/j.nicl.2012.11.010,,#2863,DeZeeuw 2013,"",""
Gender specific short stature in male adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Hu, Y.-P.; Wehrly, R.; Gorrindo, T.; Hezel, D.M.; Gironda, C.; Jenike, M.A.; Evelyn Stewart, S.","Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness with frequent childhood onset and notable gender differences. Anecdotally, male OCD-affected youth frequently report concerns about short stature, resulting in endocrinology consultation. Initial reports have described this phenomenon, yet none have systematically analyzed potential confounders for this observation or examined for this in adults. Determining whether short stature is truly associated with OCD among adolescent males is important given its emotional impacts and costs of potentially unnecessary medical evaluations. This may also inform future studies of the potential complex etiologic overlaps between OCD, neuroendocrine pathophysiology and genetic risk variants. Methods: A total of 42 adolescents (9-20 years old) were recruited from a tertiary Pediatric OCD clinic between 2008 and 2010. Subjects with a DSM-IV OCD diagnosis who provided voluntary informed consent/assent were included; those with comorbid eating disorders were excluded. Height and weight were measured and transformed into percentiles using the US CDC growth census database (NHANES 2000). Clinical variables were compared by gender via the Fisher's exact test using a significance threshold of p<0.05. A multiple regression model predicting short stature was built to control for potential confounders. For secondary analyses, height and weight were collected from a random sample of OCD-affected adults (20-33 years old) at an OCD treatment program to examine for short stature among OCD-affected men. Results: The mean height percentile was 33.9% (SD 29.6) for male and 51.5% (SD 31.1) for female adolescents, with significantly more cases of short stature (<20%ile for age) among males (p=0.004). Comparative analyses demonstrated no significant confounding gender differences accounting for observed height differences (p>0.05). After adjusting for important clinical covariates, including serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) use, psychostimulant use, and Tourette history, short stature remained strongly associated with male gender (OR=7.4; 95% CI: 1.5-36.6; p=0.01). This gender difference was not found in a comparable adult sample (p=0.45), which had no elevated incidence of short stature. Conclusions: Short stature is common among adolescent OCD-affected males but not females, and appears to normalize by adulthood. This feature does not appear to be attributable to confounding clinical factors such as medication use. © 2012.",2013,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,2,1,30-36,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2012.07.009,,#2865,Hu 2013,"",""

Impact of early-life stress on the medial prefrontal cortex functions-a search for the pathomechanisms of anxiety and mood disorders,"Chocyk, A.; Majcher-Maoelanka, I.; Dudys, D.; Przyborowska, A.; Wêdzony, K.","Although anxiety and mood disorders (MDs) are the most common mental diseases, the etiologies and mechanisms of these psychopathologies are still a matter of debate. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a brain structure that is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Agrowing number of epidemiological and clinical studies show that early-life stress (ELS) during the critical period of brain development may increase the risk for anxiety and MDs. Neuroimaging analyses in humans and numerous reports from animal models clearly demonstrate that ELS affects behaviors that are dependent on the mPFC, as well as neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity within the mPFC. The mechanisms engaged in ELS-induced changes in mPFC function involve alterations in the developmental trajectory of the mPFC and may be responsible for the emergence of both early-onset (during childhood and adolescence) and adulthood-onset anxiety and MDs. ELS-evoked changes in mPFC synaptic plasticity may constitute an example of metaplasticity. ELS may program brain functions by affecting glucocorticoid levels. On the molecular level, ELS-induced programming is registered by epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in DNAmethylation pattern, histone acetylation and microRNA expression. Vulnerability and resilience to ELS-related anxiety and MDs depend on the interaction between individual genetic predispositions, early-life experiences and later-life environment. In conclusion, ELS may constitute a significant etiological factor for anxiety and MDs, whereas animal models of ELS are helpful tools for understanding the pathomechanisms of these disorders.

"Risk for anxiety and implications for treatment: Developmental, environmental, and genetic factors governing fear regulation","Hartley, C.A.; Casey, B.J.","Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting as many as 10% of youth, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence. A core component of these disorders is an unremitting fear in the absence of present threat. One of the most commonly used therapies to treat these disorders is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy that identifies the source of the fear and anxiety and then desensitizes the individual to it. This treatment builds on basic principles of fear-extinction learning. A number of patients improve with this therapy, but 40-50% do not. This paper provides an overview of recent empirical studies employing both human imaging and cross-species behavioral genetics to examine how fear regulation varies across individuals and across development, especially during adolescence.

However, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between ADHD and immune response. Methods: We investigated the associations between ADHD traits, common variant genetic liability to ADHD, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in childhood and adulthood, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parent and Children. Genetic correlation was estimated using linkage-disequilibrium score regression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to test potential causal effects of ADHD genetic liability on serum CRP as an indicator of systemic inflammation, as well as the genetically proxied levels of specific plasma cytokines. Results: There was little evidence to suggest association between ADHD and CRP in childhood and adulthood.

Child maltreatment as a transdiagnostic risk factor for the externalizing dimension: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Konzok, Julian; Gorski, Mathias; Winkler, Thomas W.; Baumeister, Sebastian E.; Warrier, Varun; Leitzmann, Michael F.; Baurecht, Hansjörg","Observational studies suggest that child maltreatment increases the risk of externalizing spectrum disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and substance use disorder (SUD). Yet, only few of such associations have been investigated by approaches that provide strong evidence for causation, such as Mendelian Randomization (MR). Establishing causal inference is essential given the growing recognition of gene-environment correlations, which can confound observational research in the context of childhood maltreatment. Evaluating causality between child maltreatment and the externalizing phenotypes, we used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for child maltreatment (143,473 participants), ADHD (20,183 cases; 35,191 controls), CD (451 cases; 256,859 controls), ASPD (381 cases; 252,877 controls), alcohol use disorder (AUD; 13,422 cases; 244,533 controls), opioid use disorder (OUD; 775 cases; 255,921 controls), and cannabinoid use disorder (CUD; 14,080 cases; 343,726 controls). We also generated a latent variable ‘common externalizing factor’ (EXT) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetically predicted childhood maltreatment was consistently associated with ADHD (odds ratio [<i>OR</i>], 10.09; 95%-CI, 4.76–21.40; <i>P</i> = 1.63 × 10<sup>−09</sup>), AUD (<i>OR</i>, 3.72; 95%-CI, 1.85–7.52; <i>P</i> = 2.42 × 10<sup>−04</sup>), and the EXT (<i>OR</i>, 2.64; 95%-CI, 1.52–4.60; <i>P</i> = 5.80 × 10<sup>−04</sup>) across the different analyses and pleiotropy-robust methods. A subsequent GWAS on childhood maltreatment and the externalizing dimension from Externalizing Consortium (EXT-CON) confirmed these results. Two of the top five genes with the strongest associations in EXT GWAS, CADM2 and SEMA6D, are also ranked among the top 10 in the EXT-CON. The present results confirm the existence of a common externalizing factor and an increasing vulnerability caused by child maltreatment, with crucial implications for prevention.

Decoding the neurological and genetic underpinnings of chronic pain.,"Bhatt, Ravi R.","Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability and disease burden globally. It represents a complex set of conditions where a biopsychosocial approach is needed for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding and treatment. This dissertation explores the multifaceted underpinnings of chronic pain through a combination of clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic analyses, leveraging big data and cutting-edge multi-omics approaches to uncover meaningful biomarkers and mechanisms. The first chapter provides a comprehensive overview of chronic pain, detailing its clinical presentation, neurological pathways—centered on brain mechanisms—and genetic foundations. This foundational work emphasizes the necessity of integrating large datasets and multi-omics approaches to identify reliable biomarkers for chronic pain diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The second chapter utilizes data from the UK Biobank to investigate structural brain differences in individuals with chronic single-site and multisite pain, as well as investigating the differences in brain structure in each body site individually. This analysis identifies pain site-specific brain changes and explores their potential role in mediating the relationship between chronic pain and suicide attempts, providing critical insights into the neurobiological consequences of chronic pain. Chapter three employs state-of-the-art genetic methodologies to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis on the morphometry of the corpus callosum, a brain structure crucial for communication and pain processing. Extensive follow-up analyses assess genetic correlations across multiple genomic resolutions and evaluate causal relationships between corpus callosum traits and multiple neurological traits, including chronic overlapping pain conditions through Mendelian randomization. Transcriptome-wide association studies further elucidate the patterns of gene expression and splicing, revealing key tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms. Chapter four focuses on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to investigate predictors of chronic and widespread pain development over time in children. First, genetic architectures were examined using Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS (MTAG) to assess the shared genetic underpinnings of chronic pain and related traits, including ADHD, depression, anxiety, insomnia, intelligence, neuroticism, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These MTAG-enhanced architectures were analyzed using multi-list, multi-gene pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction networks to identify common biological mechanisms across traits. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were then derived using a Bayesian approach (sBayesRC), which incorporates functional annotations to enhance predictive power. Finally, PRS scores for chronic pain and related traits were integrated with neuroimaging (brain structure and function) and clinical data from the ABCD cohort. This multi-omics approach was used to longitudinally predict which children are most at risk of developing chronic and widespread pain, providing a framework for early identification and intervention. All together, this dissertation advances our understanding of the neurological and genetic underpinnings of chronic pain, offering novel insights into its etiology and paving the way for precision medicine approaches to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Causal analyses of associations between brain structure and suicide attempt in adulthood and late childhood.,"Zhou, Yi; Castro-de-Araujo, Luis F.S.; Singh, Madhurbain; Neale, Michael C.","OBJECTIVE: Brain markers for suicide risk in adulthood may be detected during childhood and used for earlier detection and initiation of preventive interventions. Genetic instrumental variable analyses were used to determine whether there is evidence of lower brain total cortical surface area and thinner average cortical thickness (ACT) causing increased suicide risk in adults and whether lower measures of similar brain measures can cause increased risk of suicidality and related psychopathology in older children. METHOD: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for total cortical surface area, ACT, and suicide attempt in adults to test causal hypotheses. In youth ages 9 to 10 years old, a combined MR and twin-based direction-of-causation approach was applied to the European twin sample (199 monozygotic, 257 dizygotic twin pairs), and a hybrid traditional twin direction-of-causation approach was applied to the full twin sample (308 monozygotic, 397 dizygotic twin pairs) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. RESULTS: Two-sample MR analyses found a significant negative causal effect of total cortical surface area on suicide attempt risk in adults. MR–direction-of-causation analyses did not find a significant causal effect of any brain measure on suicidality in older children, but found significant negative causal effects of ACT on depression and internalizing psychopathology, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Brain markers of suicide risk may be instantiated differently in adults compared with older children, though lower ACT may be causally related to psychopathology associated with suicidality in these youth.

Chapter 1 serves as the introduction, delving into the burden of depression, the potential of microRNAs as disease biomarkers, and current advancements in the field. It identifies knowledge gaps, particularly in the study of early-onset disorder, and justifies the focus on vulnerability to MDD during the adolescent phase. It underscores the need for high-throughput analysis of circulating microRNA profiles in longitudinally followed cohorts of adolescents via minimally invasive biosampling. Additionally, it calls for nuanced investigations into candidate genes, building upon the established research involving miR-218 and its gene target DCC, which are known for their roles in PFC maturation during adolescence and their dysregulated expression in MDD. Chapter 2 navigates the methodology of utilizing dried blood spots (DBS) as a minimally invasive source for profiling peripheral microRNA expression. The optimized protocol outlines procedural steps, including RNA extraction, quantification, and adapter use to mitigate sequencing biases. Standardizing microRNA readouts from DBS offers a cost-effective, reliable method for microRNA profiling, potentially aiding in the development of personalized medicine. Leveraging DBS for psychiatric studies enables streamlined disease prediction and monitoring within the framework of routine clinical care. Chapter 3 moves to the core of identifying markers associated with molecular dysregulation in MDD. By analyzing microRNA profiles in DBS samples from adolescents with and without clinical depression, this study uncovers differentially expressed candidates tied to vulnerability to the condition. Gene ontology analysis delineates the targets of these microRNAs and involvement in neurodevelopmental processes. Circulating microRNAs reflect the regulatory changes in the disorder, providing insight into the intricate interplay between neurodevelopment and microRNA dynamics during the onset of the psychiatric disorder. Chapter 4 employs genetic variance profiling to characterize the DCC gene network's activity and function of in the PFC within community-sampled child cohorts. The study establishes a link between variations in this gene network and individual brain size differences by constructing DCC expression-based polygenic risk score (ePRS) rooted in PFC. The analysis reveals a novel association, with an elevated ePRS corresponding to larger total brain volume in children, offering a distinctive perspective from molecular to systems levels during early-age brain development. In Chapter 5, I consolidate the findings obtained throughout my studies, offering a comprehensive overview. I conduct a thorough examination of the limitations inherent to each study, illuminating areas where further investigation is warranted. Additionally, I present proposals for future research directions, envisioning potential avenues to enhance our understanding of psychiatric pathology. This thesis consolidates emerging risk detection strategies that aim to address the critical need to understand the dynamic biological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to mental illness. Together, these chapters depict the complex interplay between microRNAs, gene networks, and brain development.

Development of human functional and structural brain networks in adolescence and its relevance to psychiatric disorders.,"Dorfschmidt, Anna-Lena","The human brain undergoes various phases of active development during the lifespan. While these neurodevelopmental processes are fundamental to the emergence of new cognitive and social capacities, they also coincide with a period of increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, which generally have their highest rates of clinical incidence in the first two decades. Since many neuropsychiatric disorders display sex differences in both prevalence or clinical presentation, this raises the question of whether there are underlying sex differences in processes of adolescent brain development. In this thesis, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to map normative brain development, in adolescence and later life, which might differentially predispose men and women to different levels of risk for adolescent and adult mental illness. First, Chapter 1 reviews relevant research on understanding developmental changes in the brain during adolescence, focusing on prior studies of normative sexual differentiation of neurodevelopmental trajectories, and vulnerabilities associated with developmental changes. Chapter 2 investigates whether there are sex differences in normative adolescent development of functional connectivity networks, using an accelerated longitudinal cohort of healthy adolescents aged 14-25 years (N=298), comprising 2 or 3 repeated scans on most participants. Sexually divergent development of functional connectivity was identified in the default mode network, limbic cortex, and subcortical structures. In these regions, females were shown to have a more ""disruptive"" pattern of development, whereby weak functional connectivity at age 14 became stronger during adolescence, specifically in a cortico-subcortical system including many areas of the default mode network. Using open data on whole genome transcription at multiple sites in adult post mortem brains (provided by the Allen Brain Institute), this fMRI-derived map of sexually divergent brain network development was found to be spatially co-located with brain regions where transcription was enriched for genes on the X chromosome and neurodevelopmentally relevant genes. Chapter 3 starts from the hypothesis that the known sex difference in the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), with increased rates of diagnosis in adolescent females compared to males, could be the psychological or clinical representation of underlying sex differences in adolescent brain network development. To test this hypothesis, the sexually differentiated fMRI network identified in the previous chapter was further contextualized. The fMRI-derived map of sexually divergent brain network development was found to be co- located with prior loci of reward-related brain activation; a map of functional dysconnectivity in major depressive disorder derived from a prior, independent case-control study of adult MDD; and an adult brain gene transcriptional profile enriched for MDD risk genes, as defined by prior genome-wide association studies of MDD. These results collectively suggested that normative sexual divergence in adolescent development of a cortico-subcortical brain functional network was psychologically, anatomically and genetically relevant to depression. Chapter 4 reviews literature on similarity-based structural brain networks. Subsequently, Chapter 5 investigates adolescent changes in structural brain network development using morphometric similarity networks derived from the same accelerated longitudinal cohort of healthy adolescents previously used for analysis of functional network development. Morphometric similarity was found to increase during adolescence in insula and limbic regions and to decrease elsewhere in the brain.

Alcohol use among American youth: Differential susceptibility to peer influence on substance use tied to genetic risk.,"Maness, Lucas; Shaw, Olivia; Posick, Chad; Stogner, John","The behavior of peers is one of the most robust correlates of deviance and arguably the strongest influence on substance use; however, not all youth mirror their peers’ behavior. Understanding how youth may be differentially susceptible to peer influence has implications for both theory and substance use policy. The potential moderation of the peer behavior-youth substance use relationship by genetic risk is explored to determine if differential susceptibility to peer influence is partially tied to biological factors. A subsample of data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) is utilized (<i>n</i> = 1,495). Evidence of a gene-environment interaction emerges whereby genetic risk conditions the relationship between peer substance use and early onset of alcohol use in models controlling for several risk and protective factors (e.g. poverty, self-control, victimization, social support, neighborhood dissatisfaction, religiosity). Genotype appears particularly salient when youth report a moderate degree of peer substance use (when peer substance use exceeds the mean but does not reach the extreme). This finding has implications for Burgess and Akers’ Social Learning Theory and other peer-based theories of behavior. It suggests that interventions to insulate youth from substance-using peers will be particularly impactful for those at enhanced genetic risk for early alcohol use. The identified gene-environment interaction partially explains why some youth are differentially susceptible to peer influence.

Neuroanatomical and functional evaluation of ADHD candidate genes in the model organism Zebrafish (<i>Daniodanio Reriorerio</i>).,"Lechermeier, Carina","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent developmental disorders, affecting 5.9% children and adolescents and 2.5% adults worldwide. The core characteristics are age-inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, often accompanied by co-morbidities such as mood and conduct disorders as wells as learning deficits. In the majority of cases, ADHD is caused by an interplay of accumulated genetic and environmental risk factors. Twin studies report a very high heritability of 70–80%, however, common genetic variants in the population only explain a third of the heritability. The rest of the genetic predisposition is composed of rare copy number variations (CNVs) and gene x environment interactions including epigenetic alterations. Through genome wide association (GWAS) and linkage studies a number of likely candidate genes were identified. A handful of them play a role in dopamine or noradrenaline neurotransmitter systems, simultaneously those systems are the main targets of common drug treatment approaches. However, for the majority of candidates the biological function in relation to ADHD is unknown. It is crucial to identify those functions in order to gain a deeper understanding of the pathomechanism and genetic networks potentially responsible for the disorder. This work focuses on the three candidate genes GFOD1, SLC2A3 and LBX1 and their role in the healthy organism as well as in case of ADHD. The neuroanatomy was regarded through expression analysis and various behavioural assays of activity were performed to link alterations on the transcript level to phenotypes associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder. Zebrafish orthologues of the human risk genes were identified and extensive temporal and spacial expression characterisation performed via RNA in situ hybridisation. Through morpholino derived knock-down and mRNA overexpression zebrafish models with subsequent behavioural analysis, both hyper- and hypoactive phenotypes were discovered. Additional expression analysis through double in situ hybridisation revealed a co-localisation during zebrafish neurodevelopment of each gfod1 and slc2a3a together with gad1b, a marker for GABAergic neurons. Interestingly, both risk genes have previously been associated with glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism, which when disrupted could lead to alterations in signal transduction and neuron survival. Likewise, Lbx1 plays a pivotal role in GABAergic versus glutamatergic neuron specification during spinal cord and hindbrain development in mice and chicken. Preliminary results of this work suggest a similar role in zebrafish. Taken together, those findings on the one hand represent a sturdy basis to continue studies of the function of the genes and on the other hand open up the opportunity to investigate novel aspects of ADHD research by exploring the role of the GABAergic neurotransmitter system or the connection between energy metabolism and psychiatric disorders.

The complex relationship between cannabis use and mental health: Considering the influence of cannabis use patterns and individual factors: Impact of cannabis use on mental health.,"Sagar, Kelly A.; Gruber, Staci A.","The relationship between cannabis use and mental health is complex, as studies often report seemingly contradictory findings regarding whether cannabis use results in more positive or negative treatment outcomes. With an increasing number of individuals using cannabis for both recreational (i.e., non-medical) and medical purposes, it is critical to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which cannabis may be helpful or harmful for those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Although cannabis is composed of hundreds of compounds, studies assessing the effects of “cannabis” most often report the impact of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-THC), the primary intoxicating constituent of the plant. While d9-THC has documented therapeutic properties, negative clinical outcomes commonly associated with cannabis are generally related to d9-THC exposure. In contrast, non-intoxicating cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) show promise as potential treatment options for psychiatric symptoms. In this article, findings from studies and reviews examining the relationship between mental health conditions (mood, anxiety, psychosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and cannabis use are summarized to highlight critical variables that are often overlooked, including those associated with cannabis use patterns (e.g., frequency of use, amount used, cannabinoid exposure, product choice, and route of administration). Further, this article explores individual factors (e.g., age, sex, genetics/family history) that likely impact cannabis-related outcomes. Research to date suggests that youth and those with a family history or genetic liability for psychiatric disorders are at higher risk for negative outcomes, while more research is needed to fully understand unique effects related to sex and older age.

The predictive effect of family genetic risk scores as an indirect measure of causal effects of one disorder on another.,"Kendler, Kenneth S.; Ohlsson, Henrik; Sundquist, Jan; Sundquist, Kristina","Background. One potential cause of comorbidity is the direct causal effect of one disorder – A – on risk for subsequent onset of disorder B. Could genetic risk scores be utilized to test for such an effect? If disorder A causally impacts on risk for disorder B, then genetic risk for disorder A should be lower in cases of disorder A with <i>v.</i> without a prior onset of B. Methods. In all individuals (<i>n</i> = 905 736) born in Sweden from 1980 to 1990, from six psychiatric and drug use disorders (major depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia), we formed 14 pairs of disorders A and B. In these pairs, we compared, using Cox proportional hazards models, the predictive effect of the familial-genetic risk score (FGRS) for disorder B in those who had <i>v.</i> had not had a prior onset of disorder A. Results. In all pairs, the impact of the FGRS for disorder B was significantly stronger in cases without v. with a prior history of disorder A. These effects were similar across sex, stable across levels of FGRS and not likely due to clinician bias. In many of our disorder pairs, previous clinical studies suggest a mechanism for a causal effect of disorder A on B. Conclusions. Our findings provide indirect evidence that the occurrence of one psychiatric or substance use disorder often has a causal effect on risk for subsequent disorders. This mechanism may substantially contribute to the widespread comorbidity among psychiatric conditions.

However, whether the precocious or late puberty has influence on addiction in adults remains unclear. Based on the data of 336,398 European participants in the UK Biobank, we explored the associations between secondary sexual characteristics (SSCs) outset time abnormality and addiction with observational analyses. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was conducted to test for the genetic correlation between them.

The geographical distribution of the family-genetic risk score for drug use disorder in Sweden and its co-localization with areas of social deprivation.,"Kendler, Kenneth S.; Mansourian, Ali; Zhao, Pengxiang; Ohlsson, Henrik; Stewart, Kathleen; Sundquist, Jan; Malmberg, Bo; Sundquist, Kristina","Background. Drug use Disorder (DUD), the risk for which is substantially influenced by both genetic and social factors, is geographically concentrated in high-risk regions. An important step toward understanding this pattern is to examine geographical distributions of the genetic liability to DUD and a key demographic risk factor – social deprivation. Methods. We calculated the mean family genetic risk score (FGRS) for DUD ((FGRS<sub>DUD</sub>) and social deprivation for each of the 5983 areas Demographic Statistical Areas (DeSO) for all of Sweden and used geospatial techniques to analyze and map these factors. Results. Using 2018 data, substantial spatial heterogeneity was seen in the distribution of the genetic risk for DUD in Sweden as a whole and in its three major urban centers which was confirmed by hot-spot analyses. Across DeSOs, FGRS<sub>DUD</sub> and s.D. levels were substantially but imperfectly correlated (<i>r</i> = + 0.63), with more scattering at higher FGRS<sub>DUD</sub> and s.D. scores. Joint mapping across DeSOs for FGRS<sub>DUD</sub> and s.D. revealed a diversity of patterns across Sweden. The stability of the distributions of FGRS<sub>DUD</sub> and s.D. in DeSOs within Sweden over the years 2012–2018 was quite high. Conclusions. The geographical distribution of the genetic risk to DUD is quite variable in Sweden. DeSO levels of s.D. and FRGS<sub>DUD</sub> were substantially correlated but also disassociated in a number of regions. The observed patterns were largely consistent with known trends in the human geography of Sweden. This effort lays the groundwork for further studies of the sources of geographic variation in rates of DUD.

Uncovering such heterogeneity using neuroimaging-based individual biomarkers, clinical behaviors, and genetic risks, might contribute to elucidating the etiology of these diseases and support precision medicine. Methods We recruited 174 drug-naïve and drug-free patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, as well as 404 healthy controls. T1 MRI imaging data, clinical symptoms, and neurocognitive assessments, and genetics were obtained and analyzed. We applied regional gray matter volumes (GMV) and quantile normative modeling to create maturation curves, and then calculated individual deviations to identify subtypes within the patients using hierarchical clustering. We compared the between-subtype differences in GMV deviations, clinical behaviors, cell-specific transcriptomic associations, and polygenic risk scores. We also validated the GMV deviations based subtyping analysis in a replication cohort. Results Two subtypes emerged: subtype 1, characterized by increased GMV deviations in the frontal cortex, cognitive impairment, a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, and transcriptionally associated with Alzheimer's disease pathways, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells; and subtype 2, displaying globally decreased GMV deviations, more severe depressive symptoms, increased genetic vulnerability to major depressive disorder and transcriptionally related to microglia and inhibitory neurons. The distinct patterns of GMV deviations in the frontal, cingulate, and primary motor cortices between subtypes were shown to be replicable.

"Cracking the chicken and egg problem of schizophrenia and substance use: Genetic interplay between schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder, and tobacco smoking.","Chenoweth, Meghan J.","Comments on an article E. C. Johnson et al. (see record [rid]2024-99269-001[/rid]). Johnson et al. investigated the role of tobacco use, which is strikingly common among people with schizophrenia and those with CanUD. As substance use disorder contributes to the reduced life expectancy in people with schizophrenia, and as more jurisdictions move toward cannabis legalization, finding answers to these questions is more important than ever. The authors’ inclusion of African ancestry data and efforts to promote equity are commendable, however larger GWASs in African ancestry individuals are needed for robust analysis. Several additional limitations are noted. For example, the GWASs used did not collect information on the mixing of cannabis with tobacco, or on use of other tobacco products (e.g. e-cigarettes). Future studies could also test for potential moderating effects of cannabis potency and age of first use – two robust predictors of schizophrenia risk – on the genetic links between CanUD and schizophrenia. Furthermore, adolescence and young adulthood represent key developmental stages for the onset of substance use and first episode of psychosis. Thus, longitudinal genomics studies capturing transitions from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood will be key to parse potential causal links between the traits. Future work will also need to consider the role of gene x environment and gene x gene interactions in the interplay between these traits. As sexbased analyses becomes commonplace in GWAS, potential sex differences will also need to be explored. In conclusion, the work of Johnson and colleagues marks a significant milestone in our quest to understand why cannabis use, schizophrenia, and tobacco smoking co-occur at such high rates and points to a dual role of shared genetics and potentially reciprocal causal effects.

We collected genome-wide expression profiles of adults to characterize the regulation of expression and function in genes related to human personality. We devised an innovative multi-omic approach to network analysis to identify the key control elements and interactions in multi-modular networks. We identified sets of transcribed genes that were co-expressed in specific brain regions with genes known to be associated with personality. Then we identified the minimum networks for the co-localized genes using bioinformatic resources. Subjects were 459 adults from the Young Finns Study who completed the Temperament and Character Inventory and provided peripheral blood for genomic and transcriptomic analysis. We identified an extrinsic network of 45 regulatory genes from seed genes in brain regions involved in self-regulation of emotional reactivity to extracellular stimuli (e.g., self-regulation of anxiety) and an intrinsic network of 43 regulatory genes from seed genes in brain regions involved in self-regulation of interpretations of meaning (e.g., production of concepts and language). We discovered that interactions between the two networks were coordinated by a control hub of 3 miRNAs and 3 protein-coding genes shared by both. Interactions of the control hub with proteins and ncRNAs identified more than 100 genes that overlap directly with known personality-related genes and more than another 4000 genes that interact indirectly. We conclude that the six-gene hub is the crux of an integrative network that orchestrates information-transfer throughout a multi-modular system of over 4000 genes enriched in liquid-liquid-phase-separation (LLPS)-related RNAs, diverse transcription factors, and hominid-specific miRNAs and lncRNAs.

"Genetic and environmental risk factors, informative subtypes and putative endophenotypes in major depressive disorder.","Bianchi-Rimay, Tímea Anna","Introduction and hypotheses: Gene polymorphisms that are suspected of playing a role in the development of childhood onset depression are examined in our work. Furthermore, we examine symptoms or symptom groups that can be considered as homogeneous types or endophenotypes of depression, and can be associated with the investigated genotypes or alleles. Oxytocin (OXT) and prolactin (PRL) are neuropeptide hormones that interact with the serotonin system and are involved in the stress response and social affiliation. In human studies, serum OXT and PRL levels have been associated with depression and related phenotypes. Both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms and interferon-gamma +874 T/A polymorphism have been examined for their contribution to depression with equivocal results. More homogeneous phenotypes might be used to improve our understanding of genetic liability to depression. The aim of our work was to 1) determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the loci for OXT and PRL and their receptors, OXTR and PRLR, were associated with childhood-onset mood disorders (COMD). 2) to test for association between BDNFVal66Met polymorphism and childhood onset melancholic depression and 3) to investigate the interferon-gamma +874 T/A polymorphism and the somatic type of depression. We also examined the interactive effects of stressful life events (SLE) and the Val66Met polymorphism on the risk of childhood onset melancholic depression. Materials and Methods: Using 678 families in a family-based association design, we genotyped 16 SNPs at OXT, PRL, OXTR and PRLRto test for association with COMD. Examining the BDNF, in the preliminary studies and the following case-control studies, first subsets, then a sample of 583 depressed probands were involved (55 from the somatic type of depression, 162 of the melancholic subtype). Diagnoses were derived via the Interview Schedule for Children and Adolescents - Diagnostic Version and life event data were collected by means of an Intake General Information Sheet. Results: No significant associations were found for SNPs in theOXTR, PRL, or PRLR genes. Two of three SNPs of the OXTgene were associated with COMD (p=0.02), significant after spectral decomposition, but were not significant after additionally correcting for the number of genes. In the „preliminary BDNF study"", regarding the melancholic subtype, BDNF Val66Val genotype had a significantly higher frequency in the melancholic depressed group than in the controls (p=0.024). In the study examining the whole sample of depressed probands, 27.8% of the participants met criteria for melancholy. In the melancholic group the proportion of the females was higher (53.1%), though there were more males in the overall depressed sample. We detected no significant differences in genotype or allele frequency between the melancholic and the nonmelancholic depressed group. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and stressful life event interaction was not significantly associated with the melancholy outcome.

However, little research has examined the role of genetics in the expression of underlying phenotypes. We investigated whether the anorexia nervosa (AN), OCD, or AN/OCD transdiagnostic polygenic scores (PGS) predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms in a large developmental cohort in a sex-specific manner. Methods: Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN and OCD genome-wide association studies, we conducted an AN/OCD transdiagnostic genome-wide association meta-analysis. We then calculated AN, OCD, and AN/OCD PGS in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms, stratified by sex (combined<i> N</i> = 3212–5369 per phenotype). Results: The PGS prediction of eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety phenotypes differed between sexes, although effect sizes were small. AN and AN/OCD PGS played a more prominent role in predicting eating disorder and anxiety risk than OCD PGS, especially in girls. AN/OCD PGS provided a small boost over AN PGS in the prediction of some anxiety symptoms. All three PGS predicted higher compulsive exercise across different developmental timepoints [β = 0.03 (s.e. = 0.01) for AN and AN/OCD PGS at age 14; β = 0.05 (s.e. = 0.02) for OCD PGS at age 16] in girls.

From its inception, the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) has focused on the importance of brain function as it relates to the risk and consequences of alcohol use and AUD, through the examination of noninvasively recorded brain electrical activity and neuropsychological tests. COGA's sophisticated neurophysiological and neuropsychological measures, together with rich longitudinal, multi‐modal family data, have allowed us to disentangle brain‐related risk and resilience factors from the consequences of prolonged and heavy alcohol use in the context of genomic and social‐environmental influences over the lifespan. COGA has led the field in identifying genetic variation associated with brain functioning, which has advanced the understanding of how genomic risk affects AUD and related disorders. To date, the COGA study has amassed brain function data on over 9871 participants, 7837 with data at more than one time point, and with notable diversity in terms of age (from 7 to 97), gender (52% female), and self‐reported race and ethnicity (28% Black, 9% Hispanic). These data are available to the research community through several mechanisms, including directly through the NIAAA, through dbGAP, and in collaboration with COGA investigators. In this review, we provide an overview of COGA's data collection methods and specific brain function measures assessed, and showcase the utility, significance, and contributions these data have made to our understanding of AUD and related disorders, highlighting COGA research findings.

Risk and resilience in Syrian refugee children: A multisystem analysis.,"Smeeth, Demelza; May, Andrew K.; Karam, Elie G.; Rieder, Michael J.; Elzagallaai, Abdelbaset A.; van Uum, Stan; Pluess, Michael","Refugee children are often exposed to substantial trauma, placing them at increased risk for mental illness. However, this risk can be mitigated by a capacity for resilience, conferred from multiple ecological systems (e.g., family, community), including at an individual biological level. We examined the ability of hair cortisol concentrations and polygenic scores for mental health to predict risk and resilience in a sample of Syrian refugee children (<i>n</i> = 1359). Children were categorized as either at-risk or resilient depending on clinical thresholds for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and externalizing behavior problems. Logistic regression was used to examine main and interacting effects while controlling for covariates. Elevated hair cortisol concentrations were significantly associated with reduced resilience (odds ratio (OR)=0.58, 95%CI [0.40, 0.83]) while controlling for levels of war exposure. Polygenic scores for depression, self-harm, and neuroticism were not found to have any significant main effects. However, a significant interaction emerged between hair cortisol and polygenic scores for depression (OR=0.04, 95%CI [0.003 0.47]), suggesting that children predisposed to depression were more at risk for mental health problems when hair cortisol concentrations were high. Our results suggest that biomarkers (separately and in combination) might support early identification of refugee children at risk for mental health problems.

Three essays in health economics.,"Jeong, Yeongmi","In Chapter 1, I examine the effect of adolescent peers' genetic risk for depression on own mental health. I exploit variation in same-gender grademates' genetic risk within schools and across grades. I find that an increase in peers' genetic risk for depression has immediate negative impacts on own mental health, and the effects persist into adulthood for females. As potential mechanisms, I find that an increase in peers' genetic risk for depression in adolescence worsens friendship, increases substance use, and leads to lower socioeconomic status. Overall, the results suggest there are important social-genetic effects in the context of mental health. In Chapter 2, Meghan Skira and I examine whether genetic endowments linked to risky health behaviors explain variation in health. We find that among those aged 50–65, higher genetic predisposition for smoking is associated with worse health, even after controlling for individual smoking behavior and among those who have never smoked, suggesting the genetic endowments correlate with health through non-smoking channels. The genetic endowments for smoking correlate with longevity expectations, planning horizons, and measures of conscientiousness, but these channels do not fully explain the estimated relationship. Furthermore, we find that an increase in a spouse's genetic risk for smoking intensity has adverse spillovers for own health. Overall, our results suggest the genetic factors linked to smoking capture a complex array of traits that correlate with less engagement in health-promoting activities. In Chapter 3, Nicholas Papageorge, Meghan Skira, Kevin Thom, and I find that individuals with higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have lower levels of cognition, lower propensities to work, and lower incomes, and these relationships hold even after conditioning on diagnosis of a memory-related disease. However, we also find that individuals at the greatest genetic risk for AD do not have systematically different expectations about their own mortality. Moreover, these individuals are less likely to engage in planning behaviors such as the acquisition of long-term care insurance. These results imply that efforts to encourage end-of-life planning might be particularly beneficial for those at greater risk for needing such services.

Genetic influences on the interplay between obsessive‐compulsive behavior symptoms and cannabis use during adolescence.,"Kutzner, Jodi; Elam, Kit K.; Ha, Thao","Introduction: There are overlapping biological origins and behaviors associated with obsessive‐compulsive symptoms (OCS) and cannabis use. There is also evidence that OCS and cannabis use are associated over time. Thus, we investigated polygenic predisposition for OCS as predictive of OCS and cannabis use from age 17 to 19. We hypothesized that greater genetic risk for OCS would predict both OCS and cannabis use. Methods: The current study used participants from the Project Alliance 1 study, a US‐based sample, for whom genomic, OCS, and cannabis use data were available (n = 547). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were formed via a meta‐genome‐wide association study on OCS and examined as a predictor of OCS and cannabis use at age 17 and 19. The sample was diverse (52.4% male; 45% European American, 30% African American, 14% multiracial, 5% Hispanic/Latino, 4% Asian American, and 2% other groups). Sensitivity analysis was performed by gender for European American and African American subsamples. Results: Across the whole sample, the greater polygenic risk for OCS was negatively associated with cannabis use at age 17 and positively associated with OCS at 19. Cannabis use at age 17 was positively associated with OCS at age 19. The association between polygenic risk for OCS and cannabis use at age 17 was replicated in European American males, whereas the association between cannabis use at age 17 and OCS at age 19 was replicated in African American males. Conclusions: Cannabis use may exacerbate OCS through adolescence, and genetic predisposition for OCS may be associated with lower cannabis use in efforts to avoid exacerbation of OCS.

"The effects of childhood maltreatment, recent interpersonal and noninterpersonal stress, and hpa-axis multilocus genetic variation on prospective changes in adolescent depressive symptoms: A multiwave longitudinal study.","Sun, Kexin; Cao, Cong","Based on a multiwave, two-year prospective design, this study is the first to examine the extent to which multilocus hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis)-related genetic variants, childhood maltreatment, and recent stress jointly predicted prospective changes in adolescent depressive symptoms. A theory-driven multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) was calculated to combine the effects of six common polymorphisms within HPA-axis related genes (CRHR1, NR3C1, NR3C2, FKBP5, COMT, and HTR1A) in a sample of Chinese Han adolescents (N = 827; 50.2% boys; M age = 16.45 ± 1.36 years). The results showed that the three-way interaction of HPA-axis related MGPS, childhood maltreatment and recent interpersonal, but not noninterpersonal, stress significantly predicted prospective changes in adolescent depressive symptoms. For adolescents with high but not low HPA-axis related MGPS, exposure to severe childhood maltreatment predisposed individuals more vulnerable to recent interpersonal stress, exhibiting greater prospective changes in adolescent depressive symptoms. The findings provide preliminary evidence for the cumulative risk mechanism regarding gene-by-environment-by-environment (G × E1 × E2) interactions that underlie the longitudinal development of adolescent depressive symptoms and show effects specific to interpersonal stress.

Objective: To assess the interrelationships of family genetic risk score (FGRS) with diagnostic stability or diagnostic change in major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), other nonaffective psychosis (ONAP), and schizophrenia. Design, setting, and participants: This longitudinal population-based cohort (N = 4 171 120) included individuals with incident cases of MD (n = 235 095), BD (n = 11 681), ONAP (n = 16 009), and schizophrenia (n = 6312) who had at least 1 further diagnosis of the 4 disorders during follow-up, as assessed from Swedish national medical registries, observed over a mean (SD) of 13.1 (5.9) years until a mean (SD) age of 48.4 (12.3) years. Data were collected from January 1973 to December 2018, and data were analyzed from August to September 2022. Exposures: FGRS for MD, BD, ONAP, and schizophrenia, calculated from morbidity risks for disorders in first-degree through fifth-degree relatives, controlling for cohabitation effects. Main outcomes and measures: Final diagnostic outcome of MD, BD, ONAP, or schizophrenia. Results: Of 269 097 included individuals, 173 061 (64.3%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at first registration was 35.1 (11.9) years. Diagnostic stability was highest for MD (214 794 [91.4%]), followed by schizophrenia (4621 [73.2%]), BD (7428 [63.6%]), and ONAP (6738 [42.1%]). The second most common final diagnosis for each of these MD, schizophrenia, BD, and ONAP were BD (15 506 [6.6%]), ONAP (1110 [17.6%]), MD (2681 [23.0%]), and schizophrenia (4401 [27.5%]), respectively. A high FGRS for the incident diagnosis was consistently associated with diagnostic stability, while a high FGRS for the final diagnosis and a low FGRS for the incident diagnosis was associated with diagnostic change. In multivariate models, those in the upper 5% of genetic risk had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 or greater for the following diagnostic transition: for MD FGRS, ONAP to MD (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.59-2.29) and schizophrenia to MD (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.64-3.68); for BD FGRS, MD to BD (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.47-2.73), ONAP to BD (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.85-2.52), and schizophrenia to BD (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.39-3.49); for ONAP FGRS, MD to ONAP (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.62-2.02), MD to schizophrenia (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.58-2.41), and BD to schizophrenia (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39-2.56); and for schizophrenia FGRS, MD to schizophrenia (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.46-2.23), and BD to schizophrenia (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.25-2.45). FGRS profiles for incident cases confirmed at final diagnosis were more homogenous than genetic profiles for those who changed diagnoses. Conclusions and relevance: In a large population-based longitudinal cohort, the genetic risk factors for MD, BD, ONAP, and schizophrenia were meaningfully and systematically associated with the diagnostic trajectories of these 4 disorders. Over time, clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profiles became increasingly consilient, thereby providing genetic validation of these diagnostic constructs.

We assessed the longitudinal association of broad eating disorder symptoms with alcohol problems in a nationwide twin sample (FinnTwin16). Methods Finnish women (<i>N</i> = 1905) and men (<i>N</i> = 1449) self‐reported their eating disorder symptoms using the Eating Disorder Inventory‐2 Bulimia, Drive for Thinness, and Body Dissatisfaction subscales at the mean age of 24.4 years in 2000–2003.

Alcohol problems were assessed 10 years later at the age of 34.1 in 2010–2012 with the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index. Results Eating disorder symptoms were associated with later alcohol problems (odds ratio per point increase 1.02–1.18). Bulimia showed stronger associations among men than women (p for interaction .012). Drive for muscularity and height dissatisfaction were also associated with later alcohol problems, but supplement use was not.

The current case reports on monochromic, diamniotic twins (i.e. genetically identical, sharing one placenta, with separate amniotic sacs), who completed a rigorous diagnostic assessment and neuroimaging in the context of a research study. This case report compared the proband twin and the co-twin to seven healthy controls (carefully matched for age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status; SES) on total gray matter volume and global cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as volume and CBF in six regions of interest (ROI) relevant to BD. Both twins experienced obstetrical complications, which were more prominent in the co-twin. Based on the prior literature regarding obstetrical complications as a risk factor for BD, one might expect that the proband twin would have been the one with more obstetrical complications. Similarly, in terms of childhood environment, the proband twin had somewhat greater engagement in athletics than the co-twin. However, both twins had similarly positive social and familial environments, and both played musical instruments. The proband twin had lower CBF across all brain regions examined, including global CBF, compared to the co-twin and healthy controls. The co-twin had similar CBF to healthy controls, with the exception of lower perfusion in the amygdala. Amygdala dysfunction is thought to be central to emotion processing in BD. recent review highlights that functional differences in amygdala are evident in youth and adults with BD, as well as in unaffected relatives of individuals with BD. Given the high genetic risk and young age, the co-twin is still within the peak age of risk to develop BD in the future. We have previously reported that CBF is increased among euthymic adolescents with BD and that, among adolescents with BD, depression is associated with lower regional CBF including in the ACC and the amygdala. As the proband twin was experiencing mild depressive symptoms at the time of the scan, observed differences in CBF may be depression-related. While the current case report did not identify meaningful differences in gray matter structure, prior studies have established the potential value of examining brain structure in relation to the familial risk of BD. Integrating CBF measures in longitudinal studies in youth at risk for BD may allow for novel insights regarding the development and course of early-onset BD.

A further investigation of inclusive well‐being, in terms of five well‐being spectrum (5‐WBS) traits including neuroticism, depression, loneliness, life satisfaction, and positive affect, among adults with ASD may deepen our understanding of their well‐being, and lead to the possibility to further modify societal supportive mechanisms for individuals with ASD. This study aims to investigate if a genetic predisposition for ASD is associated with 5‐WBS traits using polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS for ASD were calculated based on the latest genome‐wide association study of ASD by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (18,381 cases, 27,969 controls) and were created in the independent cohort UK Biobank. Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between ASD PRS and 5‐WBS traits in the UK Biobank population including 337,423 individuals. ASD PRS were significantly associated with all 5‐WBS traits, showing a positive association with the negative WBS traits, neuroticism (max <i>R²</i> = 0.04%, <i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), depression (max <i>R²</i> = 0.06%, <i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), loneliness (max <i>R²</i> = 0.04%, <i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), and a negative association with the positive WBS traits, life satisfaction (max <i>R²</i> = 0.08%, <i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), positive affect (max <i>R²</i> = 0.10%,<i> p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). The findings suggest that adults carrying a high load of risk single nucleotide peptides (SNPs) for ASD are more likely to report decreased well‐being. The study demonstrates a considerable connection between susceptibility to ASD, its underlying genetic etiology and well‐being.

Cortical gyrification morphology in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.,"Gharehgazlou, Avideh","The formation of cortical gyrification in early brain development remains a perplexing phenomenon in the field of neuroscience. The important roles of both genetic and environmental factors are evident in cortical gyrification morphology. With the aim of enhancing our knowledge regarding cortical gyrification morphology, we investigate cortical gyrification in neurodevelopmental conditions with largely genetic bases (Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD) as well as in a psychiatric condition characterized by a pathological response to traumatic stress (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD). This general aim is achieved through three separate manuscripts including a thorough qualitative (24 ASD and ADHD studies) and quantitative (n = 977, from 10 ASD studies) syntheses of ASD and ADHD cortical gyrification literatures, an examination of local degrees of cortical gyrification (local Gyrification Index, lGI) in a large sample of male and female children and adolescents with ASD and ADHD relative to typically developing peers (n = 539, 6-17 years of age) and an investigation of local degrees of cortical gyrification (lGI) in stress-exposed adult active service men with and without PTSD (n = 44, 26-48 years of age). We found cortical gyrification atypicalities in individuals with PTSD relative to those without PTSD but no significant differences in cortical gyrification between individuals with ASD and ADHD and typically developing controls. The PTSD finding is suggestive of plasticity of cortical gyrification following an environmental risk factor likely in individuals who may have other pre-existing or post-PTSD risk factors. The findings from the study of neurodevelopmental disorders under investigation may be suggestive of either the lack of involvement of the genetic risk factors of ASD and ADHD in cortical gyrification morphology or alternatively that the highly heterogeneous natures of these disorders prohibit the identification of such associations in small and more homogenous subgroups.

A methylation study implicates the rewiring of brain neural circuits during puberty in the emergence of sex differences in depression symptoms.,"Chan, Robin F.; Copeland, William E.; Zhao, Min; Xie, Lin Y.; Costello, Jane; Aberg, Karolina A.; van den Oord, Edwin J. C. G.","Background: Women are 1.5–3 times more likely to suffer from depression than men. This sex bias first emerges during puberty and then persists across the reproductive years. As the cause remains largely elusive, we performed a methylation‐wide association study (MWAS) to generate novel hypotheses. Methods: We assayed nearly all 28 million possible methylation sites in blood in 595 blood samples from 487 participants aged 9–17. MWASs were performed to identify methylation sites associated with increasing sex differences in depression symptoms as a function of pubertal stage. Epigenetic deconvolution was applied to perform analyses on a cell‐type specific level. Results: In monocytes, a substantial number of significant associations were detected after controlling the FDR at 0.05. These results could not be explained by plasma testosterone/estradiol or current/lifetime trauma. Our top results in monocytes were significantly enriched (ratio of 2.48) for genes in the top of a large genome‐wide association study (GWAS) meta‐analysis of depression and neurodevelopment‐related Gene Ontology (GO) terms that remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. Focusing on our most robust findings (70 genes overlapping with the GWAS meta‐analysis and the significant GO terms), we find genes coding for members of each of the major classes of axon guidance molecules (netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins, and cell adhesion molecules). Many of these genes were previously implicated in rodent studies of brain development and depression‐like phenotypes, as well as human methylation, gene expression and GWAS studies. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the emergence of sex differences in depression may be related to the differential rewiring of brain circuits between boys and girls during puberty.

Previous evidence reports a common genetic background of psychotic and metabolic disorders. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on the progression of the metabolic profile in a first-episode psychosis (FEP) cohort. Method: Of the 231 FEP individuals included in the study, 192–220 participants were included in basal analysis and 118–179 in longitudinal 6-month models. Eleven psychopathologic and metabolic PRSs were constructed. Basal and longitudinal PRSs association with metabolic measurements was assessed by statistical analyses. Results: No major association of psychopathological PRSs with the metabolic progression was found. However, high risk individuals for depression and cholesterol-related PRSs reported a higher increase of cholesterol levels during the follow-up (FDR ≤ 0.023 for all analyses). Their effect was comparable to other well-established pharmacological and environmental risk factors (explaining at least 1.2% of total variance). Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence of the effects of metabolic genetic risk on the development of metabolic dysregulation. The future establishment of genetic profiling tools in clinical procedures could enable practitioners to better personalize antipsychotic treatment selection and dosage.

Genetic differences between suicide deaths and deaths of undetermined intent.,"Edwards, Alexis C.; Ohlsson, Henrik; Mościcki, Eve K.; Sundquist, Jan; Crump, Casey; Kendler, Kenneth S.; Sundquist, Kristina","Introduction: Few, if any, prior studies have considered whether undetermined intent (UDI) deaths and suicide deaths differ with respect to genetic liability for suicidal behavior or psychopathology. Methods: The authors used Swedish national registry data to identify suicide deaths (<i>N</i> = 31,835) and UDI deaths (<i>N</i> = 10,623); sociodemographic covariates; and registrations for psychopathology. Family genetic risk scores (FGRS) were derived for each form of psychopathology. The authors used LASSO models to assess genetic and phenotypic differences across outcomes. Results: In the multivariate LASSO regressions, higher FGRS for major depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide death were associated with lower odds of UDI relative to unambiguous suicide (OR = 0.91–0.95), while those for alcohol and drug use disorders, ADHD, and criminal behavior were associated with higher odds of UDI relative to unambiguous suicide (OR = 1.04–1.12). When the corresponding phenotypic registration status for these outcomes was included in a subsequent model, the associations were attenuated and of small magnitude, but many remained different from OR = 1. Conclusions: Aggregate genetic differences between unambiguous suicide decedents and UDI deaths are small, particularly when accounting for psychiatric comorbidity, but in some cases, statistically significant. These findings suggest that different analytic treatment of UDI deaths may be warranted depending on the research question. Replication in other samples, and using molecular genetic data, is necessary.

Conduct disorder in ADHD.,"Bilgiç, Ayhan; Akça, Ömer Faruk; Işık, Ümit; Ercan, Eyüp Sabri","Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most common psychiatric comorbidity in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is related to unfavorable clinical, relational, and behavioral outcomes. CD could be subtyped accordingly to age at onset (childhood-onset or adolescent-onset) or the presence or absence of callous unemotional traits. The etiopathogenesis of CD accompanying ADHD is complex and various factors such as enriched genetic risks, poor emotion regulation, temperamental risk characteristics, elevated levels of psychosocial adversity, and inappropriate parenting styles seem to contribute to the disorder. The presence and severity of CD symptoms should be cautiously assessed before making decisions on the intensity and nature of the intervention. Management of CD in ADHD primarily involves parent-based psychosocial interventions, and these interventions are more effective in early to middle childhood. Psychopharmacological agents such as stimulants and atypical antipsychotics may be also effective in certain cases. Further studies are needed to identify the developmental and causal pathways and better intervention strategies for CD in ADHD.

Aims: To examine the genetic architecture of AAO and PAO and their association with bipolar disorder disease characteristics. Method: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and polygenic score (PGS) analyses of AAO (<i>n</i> = 12 977) and PAO (<i>n</i> = 6773) were conducted in patients with bipolar disorder from 34 cohorts and a replication sample (<i>n</i> = 2237). The association of onset with disease characteristics was investigated in two of these cohorts. Results: Earlier AAO was associated with a higher probability of psychotic symptoms, suicidality, lower educational attainment, not living together and fewer episodes. Depressive onset correlated with suicidality and manic onset correlated with delusions and manic episodes. Systematic differences in AAO between cohorts and continents of origin were observed. This was also reflected in single-nucleotide variant-based heritability estimates, with higher heritabilities for stricter onset definitions. Increased PGS for autism spectrum disorder (β = −0.34 years, s.e. = 0.08), major depression (β = −0.34 years, s.e. = 0.08), schizophrenia (β = −0.39 years, s.e. = 0.08), and educational attainment (β = −0.31 years, s.e. = 0.08) were associated with an earlier AAO. The AAO GWAS identified one significant locus, but this finding did not replicate. Neither GWAS nor PGS analyses yielded significant associations with PAO. Conclusions: AAO and PAO are associated with indicators of bipolar disorder severity. Individuals with an earlier onset show an increased polygenic liability for a broad spectrum of psychiatric traits. Systematic differences in AAO across cohorts, continents and phenotype definitions introduce significant heterogeneity, affecting analyses.

Child and adolescent substance abuse disorders.,"Wilson, Jeffery J.; Ferguson, Michael","Understanding, defining, and treating adolescent substance abuse is uniquely challenging. Until very recently there was limited reliable information on substance use disorders in this population. Child and adolescent medical research has always lagged behind similar studies in adults because of the ethical concerns involved in conducting experiments with this protected population. Historically, research into adolescent substance abuse was hindered further by ineffective diagnostic criteria which were designed to identify and diagnose substance abuse in adults. The implications of untreated substance use disorders in adolescence have last effects on both the individual and the greater community. While meaningful advances are being made in the diagnosis and treatment of adolescent substance use disorders, national survey data suggest that this issue is worsening rather than improving. Substance abuse that starts in adolescence and continues into adulthood is associated with both an increased morbidity and mortality for the individual and places a greater burden on the community. This chapter discusses the recent changes to the current diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders and how these changes hope to be more representative of the adolescent substance abuser. It also examines environmental and genetic risk factors for substance abuse, common psychiatric comorbidities, the effects of substance use on the developing brain, diagnostic methods, and current evidence-based treatments.

The typology of alcohol use disorder: Latent class analyses of a population-based Swedish sample.,"Kendler, Kenneth S.; Ohlsson, Henrik; Sundquist, Jan; Sundquist, Kristina","Objective: The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical heterogeneity of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in a national Swedish sample of affected individuals using latent class analysis. Method: Using a Swedish population-based sample of AUD cases ascertained from medical, criminal, and pharmacy registries (<i>n</i> = 217,071), we applied latent class analysis to sex, externalizing and internalizing syndromes before first registration, and age at first registration. The resulting types were evaluated against 15 diverse validators and degree of resemblance in relative pairs concordant for AUD. Results:A three-class solution was preferred by fit indices. The three classes were as follows: type 1 (male preponderant, externalizing; 32%), type 2 (minimal prior psychopathology; 46%), and type 3 (mixed-sex internalizing; 23%). Repeated split-half analyses revealed the statistical stability of these solutions. Meaningful differences emerged between the classes on many validators. Type 1 had the greatest family disruption, lowest educational levels, most AUD registrations, highest rates of criminal registration, and highest genetic risk for externalizing disorders and AUD. Type 2 had the least social dysfunction. Type 3 had the highest educational attainment, genetic liability to internalizing disorders, and proportion of women. All types significantly aggregated in affected pairs of relatives. Conclusions: Meaningful and reproducible subtypes of AUD, consistent with prior typological results, can be obtained from national registry–based samples.

Molecular mechanisms of psychiatric risk genes underlying neurodevelopment and behaviors.,"Dong, Fengping","Psychiatric diseases are to a group of mental illnesses that alter the cognition, emotion, and behavior of patients. The most common psychiatric diseases include autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs). ASDs and SSDs show strong pattern of inheritance, implicating a likely genetic origin for these diseases. Inherited mental disorders frequently show symptoms at the childhood or adolescent stage, indicating that risk genes are critical for neurodevelopment. ASD and SSD risk genes have been explored using linkage studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and copy number variation (CNV) analysis.Animal disease models are powerful tools to understand the mechanism of disease inducing psychiatric risk genes because neurodevelopment and behavioral changes associated with the disease can be monitored. Here, we utilize genome editing techniques and the cre-lox recombination system to investigate how risk genes contribute to psychiatric diseases.Schizophrenia is the major diagnostic disease in the SSDs. The first gene to reach genome-wide significance in GWAS for schizophrenia is ZNF804A, which encodes a zinc-finger protein. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 has a risk allele (A) localized in an intron of ZNF804A. Schizophrenia patients with the risk allele (A) of rs1344706 show altered expression of ZNF804A. In addition, CNV analyses have implicated ZNF804A in patients with ASDs, anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder. However, its molecular functions in the brain are not clear.To understand how ZNF804A regulate neurite development, we overexpressed the gene in primary cultured neuronal progenitor cells. We found that ZNF804A overexpression attenuated neurite outgrowth. These deficits can be reversed by overexpression of FEZ1, which was identified through a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen as a protein that interacted with ZNF804A. However, galectin-1, the other binding partner of ZNF804A, cannot restore the neurite outgrowth deficits.To further explore the role of ZNF804A in schizophrenia, we generated Zfp804a deletion in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique. The Zfp804a deletion mice exhibited a reduced prepulse inhibition, which was used to assess the positive symptoms in schizophrenia mouse models. The Zfp804a deletion mice also showed female-specific hyperlocomotion in the open field test and the elevated plus maze test. We also confirmed the increased hyperactivity of Zfp804a deletion mice using IntelliCage.To elucidate the molecular function of ZNF804A, we utilized the crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method to isolate and identify the transcriptomic binding targets of ZNF804A. This analysis revealed a specific RNA sequence with high affinity to the RNA-binding protein ZNF804A. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the RNA targets of ZNF804A are enriched in RNA processing, RNA transport, translation, and mitochondrial function.In addition to the SNPs identified by GWAS, psychiatric risk genes have also been reported in patients with rare mutations. For example, mutations in β-catenin (CTNNB1) have been linked to intellectual disabilities, and rare mutations were identified in patients with ASD. As a key regulator of the canonical Wnt pathway, CTNNB1 has an essential role in neurodevelopment. However, the function of CTNNB1 in specific neuronal subtypes is unclear.To understand how CTNNB1 deficiency contributes to ASDs, we generated CTNNB1 conditional knockout mice (cKO) in parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. CTNNB1 cKO mice have increased anxiety, but have no overall change in motor function.

"Polygenic resilience on the association between childhood maltreatment, delinquency, and victimization.","Cooke, Eric M.","Childhood maltreatment is a harmful form of interpersonal victimization associated with the development of maladaptive behavior throughout the life course. Within the context of criminology, childhood maltreatment has been linked to an increased likelihood of engaging in delinquent behavior and being the victim of a crime. However, not everyone who experiences victimization will develop maladaptive behaviors, engage in delinquency, or experience victimization. This subset of individuals are considered resilient to the adverse effects of childhood maltreatment. Studies have identified several factors that promote resilience in response to childhood maltreatment. Few studies have examined how polygenic scores influence resilience to childhood maltreatment in relation to delinquency and victimization later in life. The current dissertation seeks to address this gap by using latent growth modeling techniques to assess the moderating influence of polygenic scores as a source of resilience between childhood maltreatment, delinquent behavior, and criminal victimization in adolescence and young adulthood. Results indicate that the polygenic score for depression moderated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and delinquency while the polygenic score for extraversion moderated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and victimization. These findings have implications for the ecological transactional model as well as the differential susceptibility perspective.

Results: Individuals with binge‐type eating disorders had higher polygenic scores than controls for other psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and higher polygenic scores for body mass index. Discussion: Our findings replicate some of the known comorbidities of eating disorders on a genomic level and motivate a deeper investigation of shared and unique genomic factors across the three primary eating disorders.

Cannabis use in people with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology: Results from a Mexican epidemiological sample.,"Nicolini, Humberto; Martínez-Magaña, José Jaime; Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; Villatoro Velázquez, Jorge Ameth; Camarena, Beatriz; Fleiz Bautista, Clara; Bustos-Gamiño, Marycarmen; Aguilar García, Alejandro; Lanzagorta, Nuria; Medina-Mora, María Elena","Recent studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system could play an important role in the physiopathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There are reports of effective treatment with derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The study of the genetic factor associated with psychiatric disorders has made possible an exploration of its contribution to the pharmacological response. However, very little is known about the genetic factor or the prevalence of cannabis use in the Mexican population with OCD. The objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of use and dependence on cannabis in individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology (OCS) with that of individuals with other psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, depression, and anxiety), and to explore the association between genetic risk and use. The study includes a total of 13,130 individuals evaluated in the second stage of the 2016 National Survey of Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Use (Encodat 2016), with genetic analysis (polygenic risk scoring) of a subsample of 3,521 individuals. Obsessive symptomatology had a prevalence of 7.2% and compulsive symptomatology a prevalence of 8.6%. The proportion of individuals with OCS who had ever used cannabis was 23.4%, and of those with cannabis dependency was 2.7%, the latter figure higher than that in individuals with other psychiatric symptoms (hypomania, 2.6%; anxiety, 2.8%; depression, 2.3%), except psychosis (5.9%). Individuals with OCS who reported using cannabis had an increased genetic risk for cannabis dependence but not for OCD. We thus cannot know how the increased genetic risk of cannabis dependence in people with OCD is influenced by their pharmacological response to derivatives of THC. The results, however, suggest paths for future studies.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-14077-003[/rid]). Importance: Suicide rates have been increasing among youth in the US. While the heritability of suicide risk is well established, there is limited understanding of how genetic risk is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young children. Objective: To examine whether genetic susceptibility to suicide attempts (SAs) is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study examined data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a population-based longitudinal study of 11 878 US children enrolled at age 9 and 10 years from September 2016 to November 2018. Youth reports of suicidal ideation (SI) and SAs were obtained from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia at baseline and 2 subsequent years. After conservative quality control of genotype data, this analysis focused on 4344 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Data analysis was conducted from November 2020 to February 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Children’s lifetime experiences of SI and SAs were assessed each year from ages 9 to 10 years to ages 11 to 12 years. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for SAs were calculated for ABCD study participants based on the largest genome-wide association study of SA cases and controls of European ancestry (total sample n = 518 612). Results: Of 4344 children of European ancestry (2045 [47.08%] female; mean [SD] age, 9.93 [0.62] years), significant associations were found between children’s SA PRSs and their lifetime SAs with the most robust association in the follow-up year 2 (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18-1.75]; corrected <i>P</i> = 1.85 × 10<sup>−3</sup>; Nagelkerke pseudo <i>R² = 1.51%).</i> These associations remained significant after accounting for children’s sociodemographic backgrounds, psychopathology symptoms, parental histories of suicide and mental health, and PRSs for major depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (likelihood ratio test <i>P</i> &lt; .05). Children’s depressive mood and aggressive behavior were the most significant partial mediators of SA genetic risk on SAs (mediation analysis <i>P</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). Children’s behavioral problems, such as attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and social problems, also partially mediated the association of SA PRSs with SAs (mediation analysis false discover rate &lt; 0.05). Conclusions and Relevance: This study’s findings indicate that there may be genetic factors associated with SA risk across the life span and suggest behaviors and conditions through which the risk could be mediated in childhood. Further research is warranted to examine whether incorporating genetic data could improve the identification of children at risk for suicide.

Applications of data science methods in discovering opioid prescribing patterns and the mechanisms underlying substance use initiation and addiction.,"Wang, Zhi","Substance use has been a public health concern in the U.S. In response to the opioid crisis, the implementation of both effective public health programs and behavioral interventions are needed. At the state level, prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) grant prescribers access to patient prescription history aiming to reduce unnecessary opioid prescriptions. At the individual level, children who are exposed to substances at an early age are more likely to misuse other substances such as prescription opioids and develop addictions in their later life. Understanding the interplay of genetic risks, family environment, and early exposure to substances can inform personalized behavioral interventions.This dissertation consists of three studies: Study 1 comprehensively evaluated the effectiveness of PDMPs in reducing opioid-related potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) practices. Study 2 investigated the possible pathways from genetic risks (DRD4 alleles) to substance use behaviors through multiple chronological mediators. Study 3 study examined how family conflicts mediated the association between impulsivity and early exposure to substances among U.S. preteens as family environment plays an essential role in pre-adolescent development.To our knowledge, Study 1 is the first study that evaluated the PDMP effectiveness to investigate opioid-related PIP practices with the consideration of different PDMP characteristics by analyzing a large health insurance claim dataset using machine learning methods. Study 2 examined the pathways through which DRD4 2-repeat alleles as genetic risks are connected to substance use behaviors (including alcohol use disorder, tobacco use, and prescription opioid misuse), via the mediators including chronic pain and delinquency. Study 3 filled the literature gap by investigating the mediating effects of family conflicts on the association between impulsivity and early exposure to substances including alcohol and tobacco in pre-adolescence using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study.The findings of this dissertation will advance the applications of data science methods in evaluating the effectiveness of the PDMPs to reduce potentially inappropriate opioid prescribing, discovering the pathways of genetic risks to substance use, and revealing the mechanisms of preteens' early exposure to substances. In sum, from both public health and methodological perspectives, this dissertation study addressed important issues and contributes to the extant literature in substance use using machine learning methods.

Caffeine-related genes influence anxiety disorders in children and adults with ADHD.,"Fraporti, Thailan Teles; Bandeira, Cibele Edom; Tovo-Rodrigues, Luciana; Martins-Silva, Thais; Hutz, Mara Helena; Rohde, Luis Augusto; Bau, Claiton Henrique Dotto; Grevet, Eugenio Horacio; da Silva, Bruna Santos; Rovaris, Diego Luiz; Dresch, Fabiane; Contini, Verônica; Genro, Júlia Pasqualini","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders (AD) frequently co-occur, increasing morbidity and challenging treatment. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant and acts in the brain through adenosine receptors, influencing attention, alertness, and anxiety. In the present study, we performed a gene-set analysis to verify if genes related to caffeine response are associated with anxiety disorders in 240 children and 406 adults with ADHD. We demonstrated an association between the gene-set with AD in children (P = 0.0054) and with the number of anxiety disorders in adults (P = 0.0197). In order to test if this effect is a result of anxiety in general or is related to AD comorbid with ADHD, we evaluated the association between caffeine gene-set with AD in an adult control sample. The gene-set was neither associated with the AD presence (P = 0.3008) nor with the number of AD (P = 0.5594) in this control sample. We also test this gene set with ADHD (n = 55,374) and AD (n = 18,186) GWAS summary statistics, and we did not observe significant results with ADHD (P = 0.5587) or AD (P = 0.3930). These findings suggest the caffeine-related genes play a role in the etiology of an anxiety disorder phenotype present in children and adults with ADHD.

Suicide and psychosis: Results from a population-based cohort of suicide death (<i>N</i> = 4380).,"Docherty, Anna R.; Bakian, Amanda V.; DiBlasi, Emily; Shabalin, Andrey A.; Chen, Danli; Keeshin, Brooks; Monson, Eric; Christensen, Erik D.; Li, Qingqin; Gray, Douglas; Coon, Hilary","Approximately 5% of individuals with schizophrenia die from suicide. However, suicide in psychosis is still poorly characterized, partly due to a lack of adequate population-based clinical or genetic data on suicide death. The Utah Suicide Genetics Research Study (USGRS) provides a large population-based cohort of suicide deaths with medical record and genome-wide data (<i>N</i> = 4380). Examination of this cohort identified medical and genetic risks associated with type of suicide death and investigated the relative contributions of psychotic and affective symptoms to method of suicide. Key differences in method of suicide (common vs. atypical methods) were tested in relation to lifetime psychosis and genome-wide genetic risk for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and neuroticism. Consistent with previous studies, <i>psychosis-spectrum disorders were</i> observed to be common in suicide (15% of the cohort). Individuals with psychosis more frequently died from atypical methods, with rates of atypical suicide increasing across the schizophrenia spectrum. Genetic risk for schizophrenia was also associated with atypical suicide, regardless of clinical diagnosis, though this association weakened when filtering individuals with schizophrenia from the analysis. Follow-up examination indicated that high rates of atypical suicide observed in schizophrenia are not likely accounted for by restricted access to firearms. Overall, better accounting for the increased risk of atypical suicide methods in psychosis could lead to improved prevention strategies in a large portion of the suicide risk population.

Investigating the causal nature of the relationship of subcortical brain volume with smoking and alcohol use.,"Logtenberg, Emma; Overbeek, Martin F.; Pasman, Joëlle A.; Abdellaoui, Abdel; Luijten, Maartje; van Holst, Ruth J.; Vink, Jacqueline M.; Denys, Damiaan; Medland, Sarah E.; Verweij, Karin J. H.; Treur, Jorien L.","Background: Structural variation in subcortical brain regions has been linked to substance use, including the most commonly used substances nicotine and alcohol. Pre-existing differences in subcortical brain volume may affect smoking and alcohol use, but there is also evidence that smoking and alcohol use can lead to structural changes. Aims: We assess the causal nature of the complex relationship of subcortical brain volume with smoking and alcohol use, using bi-directional Mendelian randomisation. Method: Mendelian randomisation uses genetic variants predictive of a certain ‘exposure’ as instrumental variables to test causal effects on an ‘outcome’. Because of random assortment at meiosis, genetic variants should not be associated with confounders, allowing less biased causal inference. We used summary-level data of genome-wide association studies of subcortical brain volumes (nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen and thalamus;<i> n</i> = 50 290) and smoking and alcohol use (smoking initiation, <i>n</i> = 848 460; cigarettes per day, <i>n</i> = 216 590; smoking cessation,<i> n</i> = 378 249; alcoholic drinks per week,<i> n</i> = 630 154; alcohol dependence,<i> n</i> = 46 568). The main analysis, inverse-variance weighted regression, was verified by a wide range of sensitivity methods. Results: There was strong evidence that liability to alcohol dependence decreased amygdala and hippocampal volume, and smoking more cigarettes per day decreased hippocampal volume. From subcortical brain volumes to substance use, there was no or weak evidence for causal effects. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that heavy alcohol use and smoking can causally reduce subcortical brain volume. This adds to accumulating evidence that alcohol and smoking affect the brain, and likely mental health, warranting more recognition in public health efforts.

Understanding the nature of association between anxiety phenotypes and anorexia nervosa: A triangulation approach.,"Lloyd, E. Caitlin; Sallis, Hannah M.; Verplanken, Bas; Haase, Anne M.; Munafò, Marcus R.","Background: Evidence from observational studies suggests an association between anxiety disorders and anorexia nervosa (AN), but causal inference is complicated by the potential for confounding in these studies. We triangulate evidence across a longitudinal study and a Mendelian randomization (MR) study, to evaluate whether there is support for anxiety disorder phenotypes exerting a causal effect on AN risk. Methods: Study One assessed longitudinal associations of childhood worry and anxiety disorders with lifetime AN in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Study Two used two-sample MR to evaluate: causal effects of worry, and genetic liability to anxiety disorders, on AN risk; causal effects of genetic liability to AN on anxiety outcomes; and the causal influence of worry on anxiety disorder development. The independence of effects of worry, relative to depressed affect, on AN and anxiety disorder outcomes, was explored using multivariable MR. Analyses were completed using summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies. Results: Study One did not support an association between worry and subsequent AN, but there was strong evidence for anxiety disorders predicting increased risk of AN. Study Two outcomes supported worry causally increasing AN risk, but did not support a causal effect of anxiety disorders on AN development, or of AN on anxiety disorders/worry. Findings also indicated that worry causally influences anxiety disorder development. Multivariable analysis estimates suggested the influence of worry on both AN and anxiety disorders was independent of depressed affect. Conclusions: Overall our results provide mixed evidence regarding the causal role of anxiety exposures in AN aetiology. The inconsistency between outcomes of Studies One and Two may be explained by limitations surrounding worry assessment in Study One, confounding of the anxiety disorder and AN association in observational research, and low power in MR analyses probing causal effects of genetic liability to anxiety disorders. The evidence for worry acting as a causal risk factor for anxiety disorders and AN supports targeting worry for prevention of both outcomes. Further research should clarify how a tendency to worry translates into AN risk, and whether anxiety disorder pathology exerts any causal effect on AN.

The relationship between cannabis use and sleep deficits: An analysis of both the predictive and genetic relationship.,"Winiger, Evan A.","While cannabis is often thought to be a sleep aid and there is evidence of acute use being related to sleep benefits, chronic cannabis use is associated with negative sleep outcomes. Frequent cannabis use is linked with an assortment of sleep problems including prolonged latency to sleep onset, lower sleep duration, sleep disturbances, sleep quality problem, later bedtimes, insomnia related outcomes, and an eveningness chronotype. In addition to cross-sectional associations, there is evidence of a bidirectional relationship between these domains, such that early sleep deficits predict later cannabis use and early cannabis use/exposure predicts later sleep factors (although there is a scarcity of research on the latter). With evidence of both cross-sectional associations and a bidirectional relationship between cannabis use and sleep deficits, there could be an underlying common liability such as shared or common genetic influences responsible for this association. This dissertation presents the first evidence of a direct genetic relationship between cannabis use and sleep deficits using genetically informed methods which include twin models, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), polygenic risk score prediction (PRS), and latent causal variable analysis (LCV). Furthermore, this work provides additional support for the developing and emerging theory of early cannabis use/exposure being associated with later sleep deficits by extending prior findings to include clinical sleep outcomes. Study I provides evidence that prenatal cannabis exposure is associated with increased maternal reports of 9-10-year-old children's potential sleep disorders, establishing a relationship between the earliest possible exposure to cannabis and later childhood clinical sleep outcomes. Study II provides an analysis of both the shared genetic liability and the predictive relationship between early regular cannabis use and later adult sleep duration using twin models. Study III extends these finding to clinical sleep outcomes by conducting a twin study focused on the shared genetic liability of early regular cannabis use and adult insomnia related outcomes. Study IV complements and builds on these twin models by using modern genomic methods such as LDSC and PRS to demonstrate a genetic relationship between cannabis use behaviors and both sleep deficits and an eveningness chronotype. Study V utilizes a multitude of substance use behaviors (including lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder) and both objective and subjective sleep/activity phenotypes/endophenotypes to analyze genetic associations between these domains and test for potential causality using LCV analysis. Overall, these studies present novel and converging evidence of a shared genetic relationship between cannabis use behaviors and sleep deficits, suggesting that there are genes that predispose individuals to both. Additionally, these studies provide support for the emerging hypothesis that early cannabis use/exposure is associated with later sleep outcomes.

Integrating genome-wide association study and expression quantitative trait loci data identifies <i>NEGR1</i> as a causal risk gene of major depression disorder.,"Wang, Xin; Cheng, Weiqiu; Zhu, Jin; Yin, Hongtao; Chang, Suhua; Yue, Weihua; Yu, Hao","<i>Background:</i> Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic variants associated with major depression disorder (MDD). However, pinpointing the causal variants which are responsible for the association signal at a risk locus remains a major challenge. Methods: We used Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) with Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS summary and brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to identify genes whose expression levels are causally associated with MDD. Then we performed differential expression analysis, methylation quantitative trait loci analysis, and cognitive genetics analysis to investigate the potential roles of risk genes in the pathogenesis of MDD. Results: Through SMR integrative analysis, we identified the SNP rs10789336 located in Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) gene significantly affected the expression level of RPL31P12 in brain tissues and contributed to the risk of MDD (<i>P</i> = 1.96 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Consistently, the SNP rs10789336 was associated with the methylation levels of three nearby DNA methylation sites, including cg09256413 (NEGR1, <i>P</i> = 1.72 × 10<sup>−10</sup>), cg11418303 (prostaglandin E receptor 3 [PTGER3],<i> P</i> = 4.78 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), and cg23032215 (ZRANB2 antisense RNA 2 [ZRANB2-AS2], <i>P</i> = 1.23 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Differential expression analysis suggested that the NEGR1 gene was upregulated in prefrontal cortex (<i>P</i> = 5.14 × 10<sup>−3</sup>).

Several loci in the gene have been nominally associated with aggression in genome-wide association studies, the risk alleles being more frequent in the general population. We have hence examined the association of four <i>RBFOX1</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms, previously found related to aggressive traits, with aggressiveness, personality, and alcohol use disorder in birth cohort representative samples. Methods: We used both birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality Behavior and Health Study (ECPBHS; original <i>n</i> = 1,238). Aggressiveness was assessed using the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the Lifetime History of Aggressiveness structured interview at age 25 (younger cohort) or 33 (older cohort).

The objective of this study was to define ADHD-associated candidate genes and their associated molecular modules and biological themes, based on the analysis of rare genetic variants. Methods: The authors combined data from 11 published copy number variation studies in 6,176 individuals with ADHD and 25,026 control subjects and prioritized genes by applying an integrative strategy based on criteria including recurrence in individuals with ADHD,absence in control subjects, complete coverage in copy number gains, and presence in the minimal region common to overlapping copy number variants (CNVs), as well as on protein-protein interactions and information from cross-species genotype-phenotype annotation. Results: The authors localized 2,241 eligible genes in the 1,532 reported CNVs, of which they classified 432 as high-priority ADHD candidate genes. The high-priority ADHD candidate genes were significantly coexpressed in the brain. A network of 66 genes was supported by ADHD-relevant phenotypes in the cross-species-database. Four significantly interconnected protein modules were found among the high-priority ADHD genes. A total of 26 genes were observed across all applied bioinformatic methods.

Interaction of <i>FTO rs9939609</i> and the native American-origin <i>ABCA1</i> p.Arg230Cys with circulating leptin levels in Mexican adolescents diagnosed with eating disorders: Preliminary results.,"Genis-Mendoza, Alma Delia; Martínez-Magaña, José Jaime; Ruiz-Ramos, David; Gonzalez-Covarrubias, Vanessa; Tovilla-Zarate, Carlos Alfonso; Narvaez, Mari Lilia López; Castro, Thelma Beatriz Gonzalez; Juárez-Rojop, Isela Esther; Nicolini, Humberto","Eating disorders (ED) are characterized by disruption of eating behaviour and alteration of food intake. Leptin, is one of the main hormones that modulate food intake and are altered in individuals diagnosed with ED. Genetic risk variants for obesity, like those reported inFTO and ABCA1, have also been associated to ED disorders. The present study aimed to analysed leptin circulating levels and the interaction between obesity-risk variants in FTO and ABCA1, in adolescents diagnosed with ED. A total of 99 individuals diagnosed with ED were genotype using Taqman probes for FTO (rs9939609) and ABCA1 (p.Arg230Cys, rs9282541). Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were utilized to determined circulating leptin. Differences in leptin concentration were analysed by t-Student or ANOVA test. Gene-gene interaction were analysed using general estimation equations. Circulating leptin levels differed between the three diagnostic groups, lead by individuals diagnosed with binge eating-disorder. In individuals with more than 3 of episodes of binge-eating per week having the highest leptin levels. Also, we found that carriers of both risk alleles had the highest leptin levels. Our observations found an interaction between FTO rs9969609 and the native American-origin ABCA1 p.Arg230Cys to modulate circulating leptin levels in Mexican adolescents diagnosed with eating-disorders.

Genome-wide DNA methylation differences in nucleus accumbens of smokers vs. nonsmokers.,"Markunas, Christina A.; Semick, Stephen A.; Quach, Bryan C.; Tao, Ran; Deep-Soboslay, Amy; Carnes, Megan U.; Bierut, Laura J.; Hyde, Thomas M.; Kleinman, Joel E.; Johnson, Eric O.; Jaffe, Andrew E.; Hancock, Dana B.","Numerous DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers of cigarette smoking have been identified in peripheral blood studies, but because of tissue specificity, blood-based studies may not detect brain-specific smoking-related DNAm differences that may provide greater insight as neurobiological indicators of smoking and its exposure effects. We report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of smoking in human postmortem brain, focusing on nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a key brain region in developing and reinforcing addiction. Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC array data from 221 decedents (120 European American [23% current smokers], 101 African American [26% current smokers]) were analyzed. DNAm by smoking (current vs. nonsmoking) was tested within each ancestry group using robust linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, cell-type proportion, DNAm-derived negative control principal components (PCs), and genotype-derived PCs. The resulting ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis. We extended our NAc findings, using published smoking EWAS results in blood, to identify DNAm smoking effects that are unique (tissue-specific) vs. shared between tissues (tissue-shared). We identified seven CpGs (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05), of which three CpGs are located near genes previously indicated with blood-based smoking DNAm biomarkers: <i>ZIC1, ZCCHC24</i>, and <i>PRKDC</i>. The other four CpGs are novel for smoking-related DNAm changes: <i>ABLIM3, APCDD1L, MTMR6</i>, and CTCF. None of the seven smoking-related CpGs in NAc are driven by genetic variants that share association signals with predisposing genetic risk variants for smoking, suggesting that the DNAm changes reflect consequences of smoking. Our results provide the first evidence for smoking-related DNAm changes in human NAc, highlighting CpGs that were undetected as peripheral biomarkers and may reflect brain-specific responses to smoking exposure.

Effects of youth cannabis use on young adult functioning.,"Hamdi, Nayla","Youth cannabis use is associated with psychiatric problems, cognitive impairment, educational underachievement, and unemployment. Individuals with genetic liabilities, such as carriers of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val allele, may be particularly sensitive to the effects of cannabis use, but evidence for gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction is inconclusive. It is also unclear if youth cannabis use causes negative outcomes, or if unmeasured factors are responsible for both cannabis use and functional problems. Two studies were conducted to elucidate the nature of the association between youth cannabis use and young adult functioning. Both studies were based on a prospective sample of 1512 twins from the Minnesota Twin Family Study who were assessed six times from age 11 to age 29. The first study examined whether adolescent-onset cannabis use interacts with genetic factors to increase psychotic traits and impair attention and memory at age 29. The results revealed that adolescent-onset cannabis use is associated with higher levels of psychotic traits and worse memory regardless of genotype, with no evidence for GxE interaction. The second study examined if twins discordant on youth cannabis use disorder (CUD) have different psychiatric, cognitive, educational, and occupational outcomes at ages 20, 24, and 29. This design controlled for genetic and other familial confounds shared between twins. Analyses showed that many associations between youth CUD and psychosocial problems were attributable to familial confounding. Still, there was residual evidence for a potential causal effect of youth CUD on the development of other illicit drug use disorders and on deficits in numerical reasoning, even after controlling for premorbid functioning.

Preventive psychiatry: A blueprint for improving the mental health of young people.,"Fusar‐Poli, Paolo; Correll, Christoph U.; Arango, Celso; Berk, Michael; Patel, Vikram; Ioannidis, John P. A.","Preventive approaches have latterly gained traction for improving mental health in young people. In this paper, we first appraise the conceptual foundations of preventive psychiatry, encompassing the public health, Gordon's, US Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization, and good mental health frameworks, and neurodevelopmentally‐sensitive clinical staging models. We then review the evidence supporting primary prevention of psychotic, bipolar and common mental disorders and promotion of good mental health as potential transformative strategies to reduce the incidence of these disorders in young people. Within indicated approaches, the clinical high‐risk for psychosis paradigm has received the most empirical validation, while clinical high‐risk states for bipolar and common mental disorders are increasingly becoming a focus of attention. Selective approaches have mostly targeted familial vulnerability and non‐genetic risk exposures. Selective screening and psychological/psychoeducational interventions in vulnerable subgroups may improve anxiety/depressive symptoms, but their efficacy in reducing the incidence of psychotic/bipolar/common mental disorders is unproven. Selective physical exercise may reduce the incidence of anxiety disorders. Universal psychological/psychoeducational interventions may improve anxiety symptoms but not prevent depressive/anxiety disorders, while universal physical exercise may reduce the incidence of anxiety disorders. Universal public health approaches targeting school climate or social determinants (demographic, economic, neighbourhood, environmental, social/cultural) of mental disorders hold the greatest potential for reducing the risk profile of the population as a whole. The approach to promotion of good mental health is currently fragmented. We leverage the knowledge gained from the review to develop a blueprint for future research and practice of preventive psychiatry in young people: integrating universal and targeted frameworks; advancing multivariable, transdiagnostic, multi‐endpoint epidemiological knowledge; synergically preventing common and infrequent mental disorders; preventing physical and mental health burden together; implementing stratified/personalized prognosis; establishing evidence‐based preventive interventions; developing an ethical framework, improving prevention through education/training; consolidating the cost‐effectiveness of preventive psychiatry; and decreasing inequalities. These goals can only be achieved through an urgent individual, societal, and global level response, which promotes a vigorous collaboration across scientific, health care, societal and governmental sectors for implementing preventive psychiatry, as much is at stake for young people with or at risk for emerging mental disorders.

"Autophagy, apoptosis, and neurodevelopmental genes might underlie selective brain region vulnerability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","Hess, Jonathan L.; Radonjić, Nevena V.; Patak, Jameson; Glatt, Stephen J.; Faraone, Stephen V.","Large-scale brain imaging studies by the ENIGMA Consortium identified structural changes associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is not clear why some brain regions are impaired and others spared by the etiological risks for ADHD. We hypothesized that spatial variation in brain cell organization and/or pathway expression levels contribute to selective brain region vulnerability (SBRV) in ADHD. In this study, we used the largest available collection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results from the ADHD ENIGMA Consortium (subcortical MRI <i>n</i> = 3242; cortical MRI <i>n</i> = 4180) along with high-resolution postmortem brain microarray data from Allen Brain Atlas (donors <i>n</i> = 6) from 22 brain regions to investigate our SBRV hypothesis. We performed deconvolution of the bulk transcriptomic data to determine abundances of neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the brain. We assessed the relationships between gene-set expression levels, cell abundance, and standardized effect sizes representing regional changes in brain sizes in cases of ADHD. Our analysis yielded significant correlations between apoptosis, autophagy, and neurodevelopment genes with smaller brain sizes in ADHD, along with associations to regional abundances of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The lack of enrichment of common genetic risk variants for ADHD within implicated gene sets suggests an environmental etiology to these differences. This work provides novel mechanistic clues about SBRV in ADHD.

In the original article, there were some errors in Tables 1 and 2. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-11602-007[/rid]). Importance: Establishing genetic contributions to the transmission of bipolar disorder (BD) from parents to offspring may inform the risk of developing this disorder and further serve to validate BD in youth. Objective: To evaluate the specific association of BD polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on the familial transmission and validity of pediatric BD. Design, setting, and participants: This community-based case-control longitudinal study (Pittsburgh Biological Offspring Study) included parents with BD I/II and their offspring and parents without BD (healthy or non-BD psychopathology) and their offspring. Participants were recruited between March 2001 and May 2007, and analysis took place from December 2020 to September 2021. Exposures: PRSs for BD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Main outcomes and measures: Participants were prospectively evaluated using standardized interviews blind to parental diagnosis. DNA was extracted from saliva and genotyped. PRSs were constructed based on independent large-scale genome-wide association studies. Results: A total of 156 parents with BD I/II and 180 parents without BD (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [7.9] years; 241 female [72%]) as well as 251 offspring of parents with BD and 158 offspring of parents without BD (mean [SD] age, 10.4 [4.7] years; 213 female [52%]) of European ancestry were analyzed. Participants were assessed a mean of 6.7 times during a mean (SD) of 13 (3.4) years of follow-up (84% retention). More offspring of parents with BD developed BD (58 [23.1%] vs 8 [5.1%]; P &lt; .001) and depression (126 [50.2%] vs 52 [32.9%]; P &lt; .001) compared with offspring of parents without BD. BD PRS was higher in both parents and offspring with BD than parents and offspring without BD (parents: odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.89; P &lt; .001; explained 4.8% of the phenotypic variance vs offspring: hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.7; P = .02; explained 5.0% of the phenotypic variance). BD PRS did not differ across BD subtypes. In a model combining parental and offspring BD PRS, the parental BD PRS association with offspring BD was fully mediated by offspring BD PRS (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05-1.86; P = .02). Parental BD had a stronger direct association than parental or offspring BD PRS with offspring BD risk (hazard ratio, 5.21; 95% CI, 1.86-14.62; P = .002), explaining 30% of the variance. Parental and offspring BD PRS explained 6% of the BD onset variance beyond parental diagnosis. There were no significant between-group differences in PRSs for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in parents or offspring and they were not significantly associated with BD onset. Conclusions and relevance: The findings of this study add to the extant clinical validation of BD in youth. Parental BD and offspring BD PRS independently associated with the risk of BD in offspring. Although this is promising, the association of BD PRS was relatively small and cannot be used alone to determine BD risk until further developments occur.

Preempting the development of antisocial behavior and psychopathic traits.,"Junewicz, Alexandra; Billick, Stephen Bates","Antisocial behavior and psychopathic traits are subject to complex patterns of inheritance, gene-environment interactive effects, and powerful environmental influences.

Understanding the genetics of substance use: Novel phenotypic and large-scale genomic approaches.,"Brazel, David","Substance abuse is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both the developing and the developed worlds. For example, approximately 88,000 people die each year from alcohol- related causes and the annual cost to society of alcohol misuse is estimated to be $249,000,000,000. Converging lines of evidence indicate that these behaviors are substantially heritable: twin and adoption studies have found significant genetic effects for initiation, intensity of use, dependence, and abuse for alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene studies have found a number of robust associations between genetic variants and substance use and dependence. Twin studies have found evidence for common genetic liability across drugs and for distinct genetic influences on substance use initiation and on quantity of use and substance dependence after initiation. Chapter 2 of this thesis describes a rare variant GWAS meta-analysis focused primarily on the role of exonic variants in alcohol and smoking behavior. Across 17 contributing studies, most using the Exome Chip, I assembled a total sample size of between 70,847 and 164,142 individuals for five standard phenotypes: cigarettes per day, smoking initiation, pack years, age of smoking initiation, and drinks per week. In this meta-analysis, I performed single variant tests, gene-based burden tests, and tests conditioned on the effects of common variants. I replicated a number of known associations but failed to find any reproducible novel associations. A modest portion of phenotypic variance (1.7-3.6%) was accounted for by all genotyped rare variants. In summary, if rare variants with large effect sizes exist for these traits, they must be substantially more rare than the modestly rare variants genotyped on the Exome Chip. It follows that large sequenced samples will be required to detect their effects. Chapter 3 of this thesis describes a twin study of adolescent substance use development which used smartphone applications and location tracking to measure twins' behavior and environmental exposures. Adolescence is a sensitive period for substance use. Individuals who initiate substance use in early adolescence are at higher risk for dependence diagnoses in adulthood than individuals who initiate later in adolescence. Excessive adolescent substance use is also associated with increased risk for accidental and intentional injuries. Genetic and environmental explanations for adolescent substance use have been advanced but few studies have examined specific environmental hypotheses while accounting for genetic confounding. In this chapter, I show that substance use behavior and related variables can be measured accurately and at high frequency by automated remote assessment and monitoring mediated through the participant's smartphone. I found that adolescent substance use and change in use is heritable, including e-cigarette use, a novel result. I used the participants' location data to measure the fraction of time they spent at school during the school day and at home at night, measures of delinquent behavior. These variables were not associated with substance use, contradicting previous results. I also found that the physical distance between twins in a twin pair increased with age and increased more quickly for dizygotic twins than for monozygotic twins, a violation of the equal environment assumption of the classic twin model and an indication that location is heritable. In conclusion, digital phenotyping methods can be used to obtain high quality, longitudinal data in a scalable fashion.

Short-term selection for high and low ethanol intake during adolescence exerts lingering effects in stress-induced ethanol drinking and yields an anxiety-prone phenotype.,"Fernández, Macarena Soledad; Bellia, Fabio; Ferreyra, Ana; Chiner, Florencia; Jiménez García, Ana María; D'Addario, Claudio; Pautassi, Ricardo Marcos","Ethanol use is widespread in adolescents, yet only some transition to problematic drinking. It is important to understand why the risk for problematic drinking varies across sub-groups of adolescents. This study reports a short-term selection program to generate Wistar rat lines (high and low adolescent ethanol drinking, ADHI and ADLO lines, respectively) that significantly differ in ethanol drinking at adolescence. The S₀ generation and filial generations 1 (S₁), S₂, and S₃ of ADHI and ADLO offspring were tested for basal or stress-induced ethanol intake at adulthood, or for shelter-seeking and risk-taking in the multivariate concentric square field test (MSCF). The study generated lines with significant differences in free-choice ethanol drinking at adolescence. The effects of the selection were observed at adulthood, beyond the stage in which the selection was conducted: S₁-ADHI but not S₁-ADLO adult male rats exhibited stress-induced drinking. These effects were associated with significant alterations in shelter-seeking and risk-taking behaviors. ADHI rats spent significantly less time in areas of the MSCF whose exploration entails risk-taking and significantly more time in dark, sheltered areas. Some of these effects were normalized by the administration of 0.5 g/kg ethanol. There were no line differences in ethanol-induced latency to lose the righting reflex or sleep time. These findings indicate that genetic risk of enhanced ethanol intake at adolescence is still present at adulthood, long after the developmental window when the selective breeding occurred. Exposure to stress at adulthood triggers the vulnerability associated with this genetic risk, an effect associated with enhanced anxiety.

Individual differences in executive (dys) function in relation to sleep duration and psychopathology.,"Benca, Chelsie E.","This dissertation presents four studies that examined how executive functions (EFs) relate to problematic behaviors, such as psychopathology and atypical sleep, as well as how EFs are characterized in healthy individuals. The first study examined whether genetic risk for five different forms of psychopathology predicted EFs at the latent variable level in a population sample. The second study characterized the neural activation patterns in health individuals in response to 3 different types of EF tasks. This study (a) assessed the overlapping activation elicited across the different EF task types, and (b) used neural activation to predict high or low EF ability. The third study examined whether individual differences in sleep duration influenced either depression or EFs (a) within a single time of assessment, (b) across time, and (c) how sleep duration, depression, and EFs influence each other in the same model. Study 4 decomposed the relationships of sleep duration with depression and then EF into their genetic and environmental factors in order to better understand the underlying architecture for these relationships. In the first study, publically available datasets from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortia were used to generate polygenic risk scores for 5 different psychiatric disorders: Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Schizophrenia. I then used a deeply phenotyped (and genotyped) subset of 354 twins in the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS) from the University of Colorado Boulder to test whether or not genetic risk in these individuals predicted EF abilities. I also examined whether the appropriate risk scores were associated with ADHD and MDD symptoms or lifetime diagnoses to the same relative extent as the EF scores. Results indicated polygenic risk for psychopathology did not significantly predict EFs after controlling for multiple testing. Results also suggested that effect sizes for EFs were comparable to those for ADHD and MDD symptoms and lifetime diagnoses. The second study was a pilot study that included 30 subjects from the Colorado Twin Study from the University of Colorado Boulder at approximately age 28. These subjects were chosen because they were either high or low in Common EF ability as measured in a previous wave of data collection 7 years prior, until we had 15 of each. Each subject completed 3 EF tasks in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Results indicated that common brain activation in response to these tasks both overlapped with a frontoparietal network typically associated with cognitive tasks, and extended beyond this network. The common areas associated with individual differences in EF ability fell outside of the frontoparietal network. The third and fourth studies utilized data from the same group of 857 twins from the LTS sample. These studies examined sleep, depression, and EF when available at approximately ages 12, 17, 21, and 23. Study three looked at the phenotypic relationships between these variables and found linear and nonlinear relationships between sleep duration and EFs and depression across age. When put together in the same model, depression seems to suppress the relationship between EF and sleep duration in adolescence. Study four results showed that sleep duration is moderately heritable, and that the phenotypic relationships between these variables is typically attributable to non-shared environmental influences.

Resilience: On the children who fall up.,"Cox, Jonah Andrew","Adverse and stressful life experiences have the potential to send many children onto negative life trajectories, but there is a subset of individuals that attain normative or exceptionally positive development through, or despite, their adversity.

This dissertation reports on two studies of resilience within the Family Transitions Project (Conger &amp; Conger, 2002). In study one, life stressors experienced between 7th and 12th grades were recorded, with academic, behavioral, social, and health outcomes reported during 12th grade. These stressor counts and life outcome scores were employed to create four groups; high-stress sub-normative outcome, resilient, normative-stress normative-outcome, and normative-stress sub-normative outcome groups. A look at the effect of stress and the effects of normative/sub-normative group membership is reported. Precursors and later life outcomes for the stress-outcome groups are described. Many protective buffers found in prior studies were replicated, including resilient youth's reporting of higher levels of positive psychological constructs such as self-esteem and mastery compared to their high stressed peers. An exploration of internalizing symptoms showed no differences between the resilient group and either the high-stress sub-normative outcome group and the resilient and normative-stress normative-outcome group. Later life mental health diagnoses showed higher incidence of hypomania and Bipolar II disorder symptoms for the resilient group. Recommendations for future research include determining if these mental health symptoms are found in greater numbers within other resilience data sets. Study 2 utilized the same data set, also assessing life stressors during adolescence and life outcomes in 12th grade. The role of genetic variance on life outcomes was considered. Six genetic variants thought to confer plasticity to the environment were examined. The variants were within the following genes: DRD2, DRD4, COMT, DAT, MAOA, and 5-HTTLPR accounting for rs25531. Different approaches were utilized to assess variation in these alleles on stress-outcomes: a candidate gene approach based on stress-outcome group membership, a polygenic allele count based on stress-outcome group membership, and a polygenic allele count approach that utilized the allele counts interacting with linear and curvilinear life stressor counts as predictors of later life outcomes. Utilizing the candidate gene approach, no differences were observed between the resilient and high-stress sub-normative outcome group regarding the presence of each plasticity allele. A polygenic allele count was created for the total alleles, serotonin alleles, and dopamine alleles thought to confer greater plasticity to the environment. There was no difference between the stress-outcome groups on the total, dopamine, or serotonin polygenic allele counts. Utilizing a regression analysis that accounted for an interaction of the polygenic allele count, number of life stressors, the curvilinear number of life stressors, and interaction of life stressors and curvilinear life stressors with polygenic allele counts showed that for females, the serotonin polygenic allele model was predictive of later life anxiety and depression symptom severity, while for males, the dopamine polygenic allele count model was predictive of later life depression symptom severity. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for life stressors when studying allele plasticity, and suggest the need for further inquiry into the association of gender, the serotonergic system, and the dopaminergic system on internalizing symptoms related to life stressors.

Neurogenetics of the externalizing spectrum.,"Carey, Caitlin E.","Externalizing spectrum disorders, which include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, alcohol and substance use disorders, and antisocial personality disorder, are characterized by behavioral disinhibition and are thought to be manifestations of a common heritable liability factor throughout the lifespan. However, relatively little is known about their underlying etiology. Here, I probe genetic and neural risk mechanisms for externalizing psychopathology in three complementary studies. First, I report an indirect association between genetic risk for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and problem drinking in young adulthood, mediated by heightened reward-related neural activity within the ventral striatum, among 404 college students. I then provide additional support that such neural activity is a pre-existing risk factor for drinking behaviors by demonstrating that it prospectively predicts early versus late age-at-first-drink among 65 adolescents. Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that heightened reward-related ventral striatum activity is a genetically influenced neural risk marker for the initial stages of drinking behavior and is also related to ADHD genetic risk. Finally, I performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of retrospectively reported conduct disorder among 1675 Australian adults enriched for externalizing psychopathology, yielding novel genetic associations with rs12536973 at the single-variant level and GOLM1 at the gene level. In the sample of college students used in the first study, both rs12536973 genotype and genome-wide genetic risk calculated based on the results of the GWAS were associated with self-reported psychopathy constructs, and genome-wide genetic risk was additionally associated with blunted anterior insula activity during an emotional face-matching task. Overall, these findings identify potential neurogenetic mechanisms and risk markers for externalizing psychopathology and provide support for etiological relationships across disorders (e.g., ADHD and AUD/drinking behaviors), as well as between pathological and non-pathological externalizing variation (e.g., CD and individual differences in psychopathology among healthy college students).

Phenomenology and standard care of OCD in children and adolescents.,"Greenberg, Erica L.; Geller, Daniel A.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is defined by the DSM-5 as the presence of ""obsessions"", ""compulsions"", or both. Obsessions are characterized by intrusive, unwanted, persistent thoughts, images, or urge that lead to marked distress or anxiety, or disgust. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an affect either stimulated by an obsession or to certain rigidly applied rules. This chapter discusses the standard care of OCD in children and adolescents. It begins with the discussion of epidemiology; etiology; neuropsychological profile. The lifetime prevalence of OCD in both children and adults is estimated to be around 1 to 3 percent. The age of onset of OCD is bimodal, with the first peak occurring in late childhood/early adolescence, and the second peak occurring in young adulthood, around age 21. OCD is a ""multifactorial familial condition that involves both polygenic and environmental risk factors"". The chapter briefs the treatment of OCD. There are behavioral and pharmacological treatments for OCD, and both are effective. Cognitive behavioral therapy should always be the first approach in the treatment of children and adolescents with OCD.

The relationship between adolescent alcohol use and functioning in later-young adulthood: Disentangling confounding influences from causal processes using a twin sample.,"Waldron, Jordan Sparks","The vast majority of individuals initiate alcohol consumption for the first time in adolescence, and heavy alcohol use during this time period is relatively common. Given the widespread nature of its use and evidence that adolescents may be especially vulnerable to its effects, there is concern about the long-term detrimental impact of adolescent drinking on adult functioning. Unfortunately, the research surrounding this topic has been affected by limited attention to consequences outside of adult substance use, as well as a lack of methodology that allows for conclusions about a causal impact of adolescent drinking, which is especially problematic given evidence suggesting that familial influences such as genetic risk may confound the relationship. A series of three studies were conducted to address these limitations and elucidate the nature of the relationship between adolescent drinking and later functioning. All three studies utilized a prospective longitudinal sample drawn from the Minnesota Twin Family Study, consisting of 2,764 twins assessed in two cohorts at regular follow-ups from age 17 to age 29 (older cohort) or age 11 to age 29 (younger cohort). A broad range of adult measures was included tapping substance use and substance use disorders, antisocial behavior, mental health issues and personality, socioeconomic status, and social functioning. Using biometric modeling, the first study examined the familial influences on the association between a measure of adolescent alcohol consumption and each of the measures of adult adjustment. Delineating the source of the covariation extends the literature by furthering understanding of the mechanisms that link adolescent drinking with later functioning while also providing an empirical justification for the use of methodologies that control for familial influences. The results revealed that genetic factors and unique environmental influences were generally most important in explaining the relationship between adolescent drinking and later functioning. In the second study, evidence for a causal relationship between adolescent drinking and adult outcomes was examined through a series of co-twin control analyses. Measures of early initiation of drinking and intoxication, as well as an index of level of alcohol consumption, were all predictive of the adult measures, but the co-twin control analyses suggested that many of the individual associations were influenced by familial confounding. However, relationships consistent with causal processes were present for each of the adolescent drinking measures across multiple domains of adult functioning, with significant effects most frequently observed with the measure of adolescent alcohol consumption. In the third study, mechanisms grounding the relationship between adolescent drinking and later functioning were further examined by focusing on mediators between adolescent drinking and later-young adulthood. Drinking in emerging adulthood partially mediated the relationship with all of the adult domains, except for socioeconomic status, and co-twin control analyses revealed that this mediating effect was generally consistent with a causal process. In contrast, when controlling for drinking during emerging adulthood, the unique effects of adolescent drinking on later functioning were attenuated, although there were some specific effects for substance use measures. In summary, this investigation extends the current literature by demonstrating that adolescent drinking is associated with multiple domains of later-young adult functioning, genetic factors strongly influence the association, evidence is consistent with the conclusion that adolescent alcohol consumption has a causal effect on a limited set of facets of adult adjustment, and continued drinking in emerging adulthood mediates the relationship.

The genetic etiology CU traits is not currently well-understood. Methods: The current review surveyed the literature for studies on the genetic underpinnings of CU traits and integrated information from 39 genetic studies. Results: The results from 24 studies with quantitative data suggest that the heritability for CU traits is likely between 36–67%. A majority of the 16 molecular genetic studies focused on candidate genes in the serotonin and oxytocin systems with results that have not been well replicated. Although two genome-wide association studies have been conducted, no genome-wide significant loci have been discovered. Discussion: There is some evidence to suggest that the serotonin and oxytocin systems may play a role in CU traits; however, there is currently not enough evidence to implicate specific genetic mechanisms. The authors encourage researchers to continue to apply the most up-to-date and relevant methodology, specifically collaborations and consortiums using genome-wide and polygenic methods.

The appendix of the article has been corrected as of Feb 8, 2022. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-39396-020[/rid]). Background: Childhood maltreatment is associated with poor mental and physical health. However, the mechanisms of gene–environment correlations and the potential causal effects of childhood maltreatment on health are unknown. Using genetics, we aimed to delineate the sources of gene–environment correlation for childhood maltreatment and the causal relationship between childhood maltreatment and health. Methods: We did a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of childhood maltreatment using data from the UK Biobank (n = 143 473), Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n = 26 290), Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=8346), Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=5400), and Generation R (n = 1905). We included individuals who had phenotypic and genetic data available. We investigated single nucleotide polymorphism heritability and genetic correlations among different subtypes, operationalisations, and reports of childhood maltreatment. Family-based and population-based polygenic score analyses were done to elucidate gene–environment correlation mechanisms. We used genetic correlation and Mendelian randomisation analyses to identify shared genetics and test causal relationships between childhood maltreatment and mental and physical health conditions. Findings: Our meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (N = 185 414) identified 14 independent loci associated with childhood maltreatment (13 novel). We identified high genetic overlap (genetic correlations 0·24–1·00) among different maltreatment operationalisations, subtypes, and reporting methods. Within-family analyses provided some support for active and reactive gene–environment correlation but did not show the absence of passive gene–environment correlation. Robust Mendelian randomisation suggested a potential causal role of childhood maltreatment in depression (unidirectional), as well as both schizophrenia and ADHD (bidirectional), but not in physical health conditions (coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes) or inflammation (C-reactive protein concentration). Interpretation: Childhood maltreatment has a heritable component, with substantial genetic correlations among different operationalisations, subtypes, and retrospective and prospective reports of childhood maltreatment. Family-based analyses point to a role of active and reactive gene–environment correlation, with equivocal support for passive correlation. Mendelian randomisation supports a (primarily bidirectional) causal role of childhood maltreatment on mental health, but not on physical health conditions. Our study identifies research avenues to inform the prevention of childhood maltreatment and its long-term effects.

Developmental trajectories of alcohol use and alcohol use disorder.,"Long, Elizabeth C.","Alcohol use (AU) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are leading causes of morbidity, premature death, and economic burden. They are also associated with high levels of disability and many other negative outcomes. Twin and family studies have consistently shown that AU and AUD are complex traits influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although much has been learned about the genetic and environmental etiology of AU and AUD, significant gaps remain. These include the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of risk and protective factors, and the nature of developmental trajectories underpinning the progression from AU to AUD. The aims of this dissertation are: (1) to examine the roles of resilience and personality disorders in the etiology of AU and AUD; (2) to investigate the nature of longitudinal changes in genetic and environmental risk factors responsible for individual differences in AU; and (3) to determine the moderating roles of key environmental risk factors on the impact of aggregate molecular, or polygenic, risk for AU during adolescence. Using both biometrical behavioral genetic and molecular genetic methodologies, five key findings were observed: (1) Resilience is strongly associated with a reduction in risk for AUD, and this relationship appears to be the result of overlapping genetic and shared environmental influences; (2) Borderline and antisocial personality disorders are the strongest and most stable personality pathology predictors of the phenotypic and genotypic liability to AU and AUD across time; (3) Genetic influences on the development of AUD from early adulthood to mid-adulthood are dynamic, whereby two sets of genetic risk factors contribute to AUD risk; (4) The specific genetic influences on AU follow an unfolding pattern of growth over time, whereas unique environmental risk factors are consistent with an accumulation of environmental impacts and risks across time; and (5) High peer group deviance and low parental monitoring are associated with increased AU, while early parental monitoring moderates the polygenic risk for AU at age 20. The implications of these results with regard to prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

Refining associations between targeted genes and the development of substance use disorders.,"Olfson, Emily","Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide strong evidence for the contribution of a few specific genes to alcohol and nicotine dependence. Chapter 2 explores numerous previously identified candidate genes for alcohol dependence using a publicly available GWAS. I found that many candidate loci do not replicate, highlighting the utility of GWAS for focusing on disease associated genes. Chapters 3-5 dissect associations between three genome-wide significant genes and substance use disorders. Chapter 3 focuses on a functional variant in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 1B. Through examining 1,550 adolescent drinkers in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), I extended adult findings by showing that this ADH1B variant protected against early drinking milestones. Furthermore, I provided evidence for a gene-by-environment interaction where best friends drinking eliminated this genetic protective effect, illustrating the important interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of drinking behaviors. Chapter 4 examines variation in the nicotine metabolizing cytochrome P450 gene CYP2A6. Previous studies show slow metabolizers smoke fewer cigarettes, but provide conflicting results on the role of CYP2A6 in nicotine dependence. Using a COGA young adult sample, I found that CYP2A6 metabolism was not associated with smoking initiation or daily smoking, but among daily smokers, slow metabolism was associated with increased risk of dependence. This association was replicated in an independent sample from the Collaborative Study of Nicotine Dependence, adding insight into the complex role of CYP2A6 across stages of smoking behaviors. Chapter 5 focuses on coding variation in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene (CHRNA5), which harbors a nonsynonymous common variant robustly associated with nicotine dependence. I examined targeted sequence data of CHRNA5 from approximately 3,000 nicotine dependent cases and controls, with independent replication of common and low frequency variants in 12 studies. I found that common, low frequency, and rare CHRNA5 coding variants were independently associated with increased nicotine dependence risk. Incorporating coding variants beyond the well-studied common variant increased the variance in nicotine dependence explained by CHRNA5. Overall, this dissertation advances our understanding of targeted genes for substance use disorders by incorporating important environments, critical developmental periods, and rare variants.

In order to estimate the variance in depression explained by the genetic vulnerability, the stressors and their interactions, we fitted linear mixed models controlling for relatedness for the whole sample as well as stratified by sex. We show a significant interaction of the polygenic risk scores with personal life events (0.12% of variance explained, <i>P</i>-value = 0.0076) contributing positively to the risk of depression. Additionally, our results suggest possible differences in the aetiology of depression between women and men. In conclusion, our findings point to an extra risk for individuals with combined vulnerability and high number of reported personal life events beyond what would be expected from the additive contributions of these factors to the liability for depression, supporting the multiplicative diathesis–stress model for this disease.

Neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments in early-onset psychosis and at-risk youth: implications for intervention strategies.,"Eckfeld, Ariel Jenys","Early-onset psychosis (EOP), or onset of overt psychosis prior to age 18, is associated with particularly severe neurocognitive and social impairment, and poor prognosis (Frangou, 2010; Vyas &amp; Gogtay, 2012). While significant impairments have been documented in specific cognitive domains (Fioravanti, Carlone, Vitale, Cinti, &amp; Clare, 2005; Heinrichs &amp; Zakzanis, 1998), working memory (WM) in particular is an area that has been theorized to represent a reliable cognitive endophenotype of schizophrenia. However, the majority of literature to date has focused on adult-onset schizophrenia, in which relevant developmental processes have already unfolded. Adolescence provides a privileged opportunity to understand how psychosis-related abnormalities in the structure and function of neural networks affect the relationships between social cognition, neurocognition and functioning, as well as an opportunity to define biomarkers for development of treatments to improve functional outcomes. As such, the first study examined the relationship between individual WM capacity and task-based neural activation and functional connectivity. Results indicated that, relative to typically developing controls, patients with EOP have poorer WM performance, lower overall WM capacity, reduced neural activity in WM-associated brain regions, and reduced coupling of WM-associated regions. Additionally, EOP patients evidenced greater neural activation and connectivity with increasing age, suggesting an atypical developmental trajectory along with general inefficiency of WM circuitry. Additional insight into the neurodevelopmental processes relevant to psychosis can come from examining genetically defined high-risk cohorts, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). The second study evaluated the phenotypic overlap between EOP and 22q11DS by investigating the profile of neurocognitive and social cognitive impairment in individuals with EOP relative to 22q11DS patients and healthy controls. Despite greater overall cognitive impairment in the 22q11DS group (with the exception of verbal fluency, for which EOP patients evidenced greater impairment), patients with EOP and 22q11DS had comparable deficits in processing speed. 22q11DS and EOP patients also evidenced similar patterns of relationships between cognitive measures and psychotic symptoms. However, neurocognition and social cognition largely did not predict future functioning among the groups. The third and final study examined plasticity-based cognitive training (CT) as a potential intervention for such cognitive impairments in EOP. Results from the feasibility study indicated that slightly over half of participants were able to complete at least 10 hours of CT; dropout was primarily due to finding training boring. However, patients completing training showed higher post- versus pre-CT social functioning, and pre- to post-CT reductions in general and anxiety symptoms. This investigation into neurocognitive and social cognitive dysfunction in EOP, which incorporates perspectives from an fMRI paradigm and a comparison to a genetic high-risk cohort, has the potential to generate knowledge on a clinically significant and understudied area, and potentially produce new treatment targets for EOP.

Cognitive deficits have been posited as candidate endophenotypes of psychiatric traits, but few studies have conceptualized cognitive deficits as psychiatric comorbidities. The latter model is consistent with a latent factor reflecting broader liability to neuropsychological dysfunction, and explains heterogeneity in the cognitive profile of individuals with ASD and IA. Methods: We tested competing models of covariance among symptoms of ASD, IA, and cognition in a sample of 73 youth with a known genetic mutation. Results: A common executive factor fit best as a cognitive comorbidity, rather than endophenotype, of the shared variance between measures of IA and ASD symptoms. Known genetic risk explained a third of the shared variance among psychiatric and cognitive measures. Conclusions: Comorbid symptoms of ASD, IA, and cognitive deficits are likely influenced by common neurogenetic factors.

MAOA genotype influences neural response during an inhibitory task in adolescents with conduct disorder.,"Sun, Xiaoqiang; Ma, Ren; Jiang, Yali; Gao, Yidian; Ming, Qingsen; Wu, Qiong; Dong, Daifeng; Wang, Xiang; Yao, Shuqiao","Conduct disorder (CD), a common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents, is characterized by encroaching upon other rights and violations of age-appropriate social expectations repeatedly and persistently. Individuals with CD often have high aggressiveness and low inhibitory capacity. The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has long been associated with aggression. Effects of MAOA genotype on inhibitory control have been examined in general population. Several studies had revealed reduced activation in prefrontal areas, especially the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in low-expression MAOA (MAOA-L) allele carriers compared to high-expression MAOA (MAOA-H) allele carriers. However, little is known about its genetic risk influences on inhibitory processes in clinical samples. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was administered to a sample of adolescent boys with CD during the performance of a GoStop task, 29 of whom carrying MAOA-L allele and 24 carrying MAOA-H allele. Relative to MAOA-H carriers, MAOA-L carriers in CD showed more pronounced deactivation in the precuneus, supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Deactivation within the default mode network (DMN) and inhibitory-related areas in MAOA-L carriers may be related to compensation for low sensitivity to inhibition and/or an atypical allocation of cognitive resources.

Neuropsychological and social cognitive function in young people at genetic risk of bipolar disorder.,"Roberts, Gloria; Sinbandhit, Carina; Stuart, Angela; Leung, Vivian; McCormack, Clare; Green, Melissa J.; Mitchell, Philip B.","This chapter summarizes recent neuropsychological and social cognitive function in young people at genetic risk of bipolar disorder (BD). Neurocognitive function in BD has been studied extensively, and there is substantial evidence of nonsocial cognitive deficits in the euthymic phase of illness. Social cognition refers to a complex set of processes that enable adaptive social interaction, such as emotion perception, theory of mind, and other processes that facilitate effective interpersonal relations. In an adult sample, unaffected first-degree relatives of BD patients responded more slowly to depression-like words, and made more errors in response to manic-related words during the emotional Stroop Color Word Test compared to healthy controls. Theory of mind, also referred to as mentalizing, is the cognitive ability to attribute mental states to others, as separate to the self. Several types of measures, with varying levels of complexity, have been used to assess this construct.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder associated with KChIP1 rs1541665 in Kv channels accessory proteins.,"Yuan, Fang-Fen; Gu, Xue; Huang, Xin; Hou, Yu-Wei; Zhong, Yan; Lin, Jun; Wu, Jing","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. A number of genetic risk factors and environment factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Genes encoding for subtypes of voltage-dependent K channels (Kv) and accessory proteins to these channels have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD. We conducted a twostage case−control study to investigate the associations between five key genes (<i>KChIP4, KChIP1, DPP10, FHIT,</i> and <i>KCNC1)</i> and the risk of developing ADHD. In the discovery stage comprising 256 cases and 372 controls, <i>KChIP1</i> rs1541665 and <i>FHIT</i> rs3772475 were identified; they were further genotyped in the validation stage containing 328cases and 431 controls.<i>KChIP1</i> rs1541665 showed significant association with a risk of ADHD at both stages, with CC vs TT odds ratio (OR) = 1.961, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.366−2.497, in combined analyses (<i>P</i>-FDR = 0.007).

Molecular genetics of trauma exposure and PTSD.,"Amstadter, Ananda B.; Maihofer, Adam; Koenen, Karestan C.; Nievergelt, Caroline; PGC-PTSD workgroup","Background: The notion that genetic factors play a role in response to exposure to traumatic events was made over 75 years ago. Great progress has been made since this early inception in understanding the role of genetic liability on both trauma exposure, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The field has recently undergone tremendous growth in the area of molecular genetic investigations utilizing agnostic genome wide association study (GWAS) designs of traumatic stress related outcomes, largely due to team science efforts such as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortia (PGC). Objective: The objective of this presentation is to provide an overview of the PGC-PTSD workgroup and samples, and present the most up-to-date analyses of GWAS analyses on trauma exposure and PTSD, using quantitative phenotypes from both the PGC-PTSD broader literature, including the Million Veterans Program (MVP). Methods: The PGC PTSD workgroup sample size in Freeze 2.0 was ~200,000, consisting of ~30,000 PTSD cases and focused on PTSD diagnostic status (Nievergelt et al., 2019). An overview of recently published analyses (e.g., recent GWAS analyses of childhood maltreatment (Dalvie et al., 2020)), as well as recent analyses examining PTSD as a quantitative variable will be presented, including analyses jointly analysing trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms from MTAG, a novel method that allows for joint analysis of summary statistics from GWAS of different traits. Recent findings from MVP (Gelernter et al., 2019) will also be reviewed, ending with a meta-analysis of PTSD as a quantitative trait in the PGC and re-experiencing symptoms from MVP. Results: Childhood maltreatment, defined as a quantitative variable, was found to have a significant molecular heritability, and to be genetically correlated with depression (Dalvie et al., 2020). Further, trauma exposure defined as a quantitative variable, was found to have molecular influence and to be genetically correlated with PTSD. Analyses of PTSD as a quantitative variable yielded significant loci, with some replicating in MVP. MTAG analyses yielded additional hits, and again, some with replication in MVP. Lastly, the meta-analysis of Freeze 2.0 with MVP, resulting in ~339,000 subjects, yielded &gt;20 significant hits, including novel loci. Conclusions: Quantitative analyses of childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure, and PTSD prove to increase statistical power across analyses conducted in the PGC-PTSD as well as MVP. Additionally, the joint analysis using MTAG revealed novel GWAS hits. With more samples and sophisticated analytic techniques the genetic architecture of PTSD will become elucidated, bringing with it critical treatment implications.

Genetic influences of dopamine and GABA on adolescent cognition.,"Stevens, Benson W.","Adolescence is a time of exploration, but also risk taking, such as alcohol use. What places individuals' at risk has not been fully elucidated. Twin studies of adult alcohol use disorders (AUD's) found genetics account for around 60% of the variability. Numerous genetic association studies have been done, though most investigated linkage with genetic loci; not how loci confer risk. If genes associated with adult AUD's have impact during adolescence and alcohol use initiation, it's likely they impact cognitive functioning, predisposing adolescents to such risky decision-making. Three genetic polymorphisms associated with adult AUD's are the C allele of C957T in the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2), the 10 repeat allele (10R) of the 40 bp VNTR in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), and the G allele of rs279826 in the GABA-A receptor alpha2 subunit gene (GABRA2). The current investigation longitudinally investigated these polymorphisms on adolescent cognitive functioning using fMRI. This included inhibitory control (Go-NoGo task), attentional bias (ecStroop task), and risky decision-making/reward response (WoF task). fMRI analyses included activation differences and functional connectivity. Lastly, genetic influence on alcohol use initiation was investigated. It was hypothesized risk alleles had lower inhibitory control, greater attentional bias, risky decision-making, reward response, and risk to alcohol use initiation. DRD2 suggested the C allele had less neural efficiency during the Go-NoGo and WoF. They were less accurate during the ecStroop, and became more neuronally reactive to stimuli as they aged. DAT1 only affected WoF, with 10R making more risky decisions, having less neural efficiency and greater response to reward. Results for GABA were opposing, suggesting the lower risk A allele had lower neuronal efficiency during the Go-NoGo and ecStroop, while the G allele made more risky decisions, had less neural efficiency and greater response to reward during the WoF. However, two results suggest developmental effects during the ecStroop, in that cognitive control for the G allele decreases over adolescence. Lastly, no polymorphism was associated with alcohol use initiation. Though this study found no association with alcohol use initiation, it supports the proposition of studying genetic effects associated with adult AUD's on adolescent cognitive function.

Although there has been some work examining the effect of human glutamate metabotropic receptor 7 <i>(GRM7)</i> polymorphisms on human substance use disorders, the majority of the work has focused on other psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate evidence for association between <i>GRM7</i> and alcohol behaviors in humans using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach, as well as a gene-based approach.

A gene-based test using four Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) revealed no association between variation in <i>GRM7</i> and alcohol consumption. This study had several limitations: the SNPs chosen likely do not tag expression quantitative trait loci; a human alcohol consumption phenotype was used, complicating the interpretation with respect to rodent studies that found evidence for a <i>cis</i>-regulatory link between alcohol preference and <i>Grm7;</i> and only common SNPs imputed in all four datasets were included in the gene-based test. These limitations highlight the fact that rare variants, some potentially important common signals in the gene, and regions farther upstream were not examined.

The association between childhood poverty and adversity and the likelihood of experiencing co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders.,"Earwaker, Jenna Marie vanDraanen","Co-occurring disorder (COD) refers to concurrent psychiatric and substance use disorders (SUD). Compared to those with a single disorder, individuals with COD often require more complex treatment, have poorer health outcomes, and incur higher treatment costs. Researchers have extensively studied both the high lifetime prevalence and age of onset for psychiatric disorders and SUD independently, but little is known about the social antecedents of COD, especially how these antecedents vary by race/ethnicity and gender. I expect the antecedents do not behave universally, though they are currently treated that way. Guided by the Stress Process Model, the Theory of Fundamental Causes, and the Life Course Perspective, this dissertation aims to better understand the role of childhood poverty and childhood adversity in the occurrence of COD for males and females, and for different racial/ethnic groups. This dissertation employs a secondary analysis of existing community-based survey data recorded in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions III. Using multinomial logistic regression with a four-category variable for disorder (categories: COD, SUD only, psychiatric disorder only, no disorder), on a bivariate level, childhood poverty is associated with COD, however, with the addition of all other covariates there is no longer an association between poverty and COD. Childhood adversities are strongly associated with COD, net of other factors, in all of the models estimated. There are clear race/ethnicity differences in prevalence of disorder when COD is studied in the whole population. For COD relative to no disorder, Blacks, Asian Americans, and Hispanics, are all approximately half as likely as Whites to have COD, net of other factors. There are no conditional race/ethnicity relationships for COD. There are, however, gender differences in both disorder prevalence and the associations between childhood poverty and COD as well as childhood adversity and COD. Childhood poverty is associated with COD in opposite directions for males and females: for males it increases the relative risk ratio of COD compared to SUD, and for females it decreases the relative risk for this same comparison. This study found no moderation of the childhood poverty and COD relationship by number of adversities in the regressions conducted. Conducting a survival analysis with only respondents who have at least one disorder indicates that having psychiatric disorder compared to having SUD is associated with a 36% increase in the hazard ratio of subsequently developing COD overall. The significant conditional relationship between disorder sequence and gender shows that hazard of co-occurrence with a psychiatric disorder is higher for males than females. On the contrary, the hazard of co-occurrence when one has SUD is higher for females than it is for males. This research has clear public health relevance: above and beyond the genetic risk incurred by having a parent with a disorder, experiencing adverse events in childhood is associated with COD. Efforts to help children and adolescents ameliorate the adversity they are exposed to are important and may be able to diminish the risk of COD associated with harmful early experiences.

Neighborhood alcohol outlet density and genetic influences on alcohol use: Evidence for gene–environment interaction.,"Slutske, Wendy S.; Deutsch, Arielle R.; Piasecki, Thomas M.","Background: Genetic influences on alcohol involvement are likely to vary as a function of the ‘alcohol environment,’ given that exposure to alcohol is a necessary precondition for genetic risk to be expressed. However, few gene–environment interaction studies of alcohol involvement have focused on characteristics of the community-level alcohol environment. The goal of this study was to examine whether living in a community with more alcohol outlets would facilitate the expression of the genetic propensity to drink in a genetically-informed national survey of United States young adults. Methods: The participants were 2434 18–26-year-old twin, full-, and half-sibling pairs from Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Participants completed in-home interviews in which alcohol use was assessed. Alcohol outlet densities were extracted from state-level liquor license databases aggregated at the census tract level to derive the density of outlets. Results: There was evidence that the estimates of genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use varied as a function of the density of alcohol outlets in the community. For example, the heritability of the frequency of alcohol use for those residing in a neighborhood with ten or more outlets was 74% (95% confidence limits = 55–94%), compared with 16% (95% confidence limits = 0–34%) for those in a neighborhood with zero outlets. This moderating effect of alcohol outlet density was not explained by the state of residence, population density, or neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: The results suggest that living in a neighborhood with many alcohol outlets may be especially high-risk for those individuals who are genetically predisposed to frequently drink.

"On the genetic and environmental associations between body composition, depression symptoms and smoking behavior.","Peterson, Roseann E.","Obesity is a serious public health crisis and recent estimates of its incidence are the highest in United States history, with 35% and 17% of American adults and children affected, respectively. The clinical definition of adult obesity is operationalized as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m<sup> 2</sup>. Although the prevalence of common obesity has increased dramatically over the past 30 years-largely thought to be due to changes in the environment, such as high calorie diets and sedentary lifestyles--twin and family studies have shown consistently that relative body weight is under considerable genetic influence in both children and adults, with heritability estimates ranging from 40% to 90%. Elucidating the genetic and environmental liability to relative body weight is an important public health endeavor. To further our understanding of the genetics of BMI and common complex obesity, several studies are described that integrate clinical, twin, and genome-wide association (GWAS) methodology in the context of genetic risk scores, clinical risk prediction, development across adolescence into adulthood, and comorbidity with depression symptoms and smoking behavior. First, in two cross-sectional genetic association studies, the utility of genetic risk sum scores (GRSS) were assessed, which summarize the total number of risk alleles, as an alternative form of replication and for potential clinical utility for obesity risk prediction. Next, since there has been only limited research on when during development BMI-associated variants begin influencing BMI, a longitudinal twin study was utilized to assess the effects of adult-validated BMI-SNPs across adolescence into adulthood. In addition, obesity is comorbid with numerous medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, insulin-resistance and some forms of cancer, as well as, various psychiatric disorders including eating disorders, mood disorders, and substance use. The next series of studies aimed to understand phenotypic and genetic associations between BMI/obesity and binge eating disorder (BED), depression symptoms and smoking behavior. Using a clinical sample of overweight and obese women with and without BED, the relationship of BED, food intake and internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety was examined. Next, twin study methodology was used to investigate if shared genetic and/or environmental liability was responsible for phenotypic associations found between BMI, depression symptoms, and impulsivity. Finally, a genetic association study aimed at investigating whether genetic variants were associated with multiple behaviors, body composition and smoking behavior, or were trait-specific is presented. By utilizing several samples and methodologies and by pursuing methods development, a comprehensive approach is presented that is hoped to represent a more powerful evidence-based strategy to understanding the genetic and environmental determinants of BMI and common complex obesity, along with associated depression symptoms and smoking behavior.

However, only a small number of common genetic variants have been identified, and common variants account for a modest proportion of the heritability. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of low-frequency and rare variants in alcohol and tobacco use. Methods: We meta-analyzed ExomeChip association results from eight discovery cohorts and included 12,466 subjects and 7432 smokers in the analysis of alcohol consumption and tobacco use, respectively. The ExomeChip interrogates low-frequency and rare exonic variants, and in addition a small pool of common variants. We investigated top variants in an independent sample in which ICD-9 diagnoses of “alcoholism” (N = 25,508) and “tobacco use disorder” (N = 27,068) had been assessed. In addition to the single variant analysis, we performed gene-based, polygenic risk score (PRS), and pathway analyses. Results: The meta-analysis did not yield exome-wide significant results. When we jointly analyzed our top results with the independent sample, no low-frequency or rare variants reached significance for alcohol consumption or tobacco use.

Towards personalized medicine in psychiatry: Focus on suicide.,"Levey, Daniel F.","Psychiatric disorders cost an estimated $273 billion annually. This cost comes largely in the form of lost income and the chronic disability that often strikes people when they are young and can last decades. While the monetary costs are quantifiable, the suffering of each individual patient is no less vital. As many as 1 in 5 persons diagnosed with mental illness will commit suicide, a contributing factor in suicide being the second leading cause of death of people age 15-34. There is a critical need to find better ways to identify and help those who are at risk. Understanding mental illness and improving treatment has been difficult due to the heterogeneous and complex etiology of these illnesses. A significant challenge for the field is integrating findings from diverse laboratories all over the world contributing to the ever expanding literature and translating them into actionable treatment. Our lab employs a convergent functional genomics approach which incorporates multiple independent lines of evidence provided by genetic and functional genomic data published in the primary literature as a Bayesian strategy to prioritize experimental findings. Heritability and genetics clearly play an important role in psychiatric disorders. We looked at schizophrenia and alcoholism in separate case-control analyses in order to identify and prioritize genes related to these disorders. We were able to reproduce these findings in additional independent cohorts using polygenic risk scores. We found overlap in these disorders, and identified possible underlying biological processes. Genetics play an important role in identifying clinical risk, particularly at the population level. At the level of the individual, gene expression may provide more proximal association to disease state, assimilating environmental, genetic, as well as epigenetic influence. We undertook N of 1 analyses in a longitudinally followed cohort of psychiatric participants, identifying genes which change in expression tracking an individual's change in suicidal ideation. These genes were able to predict suicidal behavior in independent cohorts. When combined with simple clinical instruments these predictions were improved. This work shows how multi-level integration of genetic, gene expression, and clinical data could be used to enable precision medicine in psychiatry.

In line with significant overlap between age- and depression-related molecular pathways, parallel work has shown that FREM3 expression in postmortem human brain decreases with age. Here, we probe the effect of rs7676614 on amygdala reactivity and perceptual processing speed, both of which are altered in depression and aging. Amygdala reactivity was assessed using a face-matching BOLD fMRI paradigm in 365 Caucasian participants in the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS) (192 women, mean age 19.7 ± 1.2). Perceptual processing speed was indexed by reaction times in the same task and the Trail Making Test (TMT). The effect of rs7676614 on <i>FREM3</i> mRNA brain expression levels was probed in a postmortem cohort of 169 Caucasian individuals (44 women, mean age 50.8 ± 14.9). The A allele of rs7676614 was associated with blunted amygdala reactivity to faces, slower reaction times in the face-matching condition (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.04), as well as marginally slower performance on TMT Part B (<i>p</i> = 0.056). In the postmortem cohort, the T allele of rs6537170 (proxy for the rs7676614 A allele), was associated with trend-level reductions in gene expression in Brodmann areas 11 and 47 (<i>p</i> = 0.066), reminiscent of patterns characteristic of older age. The low-expressing allele of another <i>FREM3</i> SNP (rs1391187) was similarly associated with reduced amygdala reactivity and slower TMT Part B speed, in addition to reduced BA47 activity and extraversion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Together, these results suggest common genetic variation associated with reduced <i>FREM3</i> expression may confer risk for a subtype of depression characterized by reduced reactivity to environmental stimuli and slower perceptual processing speed, possibly suggestive of accelerated aging.

An exploratory study of candidate gene(s) for Delirium Tremens: Adding the new cholinergic dimension to the conundrum.,"Malhotra, Savita; Basu, Debasish; Ghosh, Abhishek; Khullar, Madhu; Chugh, Neera; Kakkar, Neeraj","Background and aims: Delirium Tremens (DT) is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with a potential risk of mortality. Search for the predictors of DT led to study of candidate genes, with inconsistent and inconclusive results. This study aimed to explore the association of various candidate gene polymorphisms and DT in a case-control design. Methods: This was a genetic association study with a case control design. Two hundred ten Alcohol dependent (AD) male subjects and 200 age matched controls were recruited. DT was diagnosed with the help of Semi-structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism. SNP genotyping was done using TaqMan assay by real time PCR (q-PCR). Results: T allele carrying status (GT and TT) [rs1824024] of muscarinic cholinergic receptor 2 (CHRM2) was found to be significantly associated with DT. When compared to the general population, this genetic polymorphism was not found to be more common in alcohol dependence per se, which excludes the possibility of spurious association between CHRM2 and DT. Withdrawal seizure was more common in the DT group and came out to be one of the important predictors of DT.

Genetic and psychosocial predictors of alcohol use trajectories among disaster-exposed adolescents.,"Bountress, Kaitlin; Danielson, Carla Kmett; Williamson, Vernell; Vladmirov, Vladimir; Gelernter, Joel; Ruggiero, Kenneth; Amstadter, Ananda","Background and Objectives: Adolescent alcohol misuse is associated with numerous long-term adverse outcomes, so we examined predictors of alcohol use among disaster-exposed adolescents, a group at-risk for alcohol misuse. Methods: The current study (<i>n =</i> 332) examined severity of tornado-related exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, emotional support, and a genetic risk sum score (GRSS) as predictors of alcohol use trajectories. Results: Severity of exposure interacted with the GRSS to predict both intercept (12-month follow up quantity of alcohol use) and growth rate. Emotional support also interacted with adolescent PTSD symptoms to predict intercept and growth rate. Discussion and Conclusions: Adolescents with greater severity of disaster exposure and high genetic risk comprise a high risk group, on which efforts to prevent alcohol use should be focused. Additionally, emotional support is essential in buffering the effects of PTSD symptoms on alcohol use outcomes among adolescents. Scientific Significance: Toward the aim of reducing adolescent alcohol misuse following disaster exposure, there is utility in inserting immediate supports (e.g., basic resources) into communities/ families that have experienced significant disaster-related severity, particularly among adolescents at high levels of genetic risk for alcohol use/misuse. Additionally, prevention efforts aimed at improving emotional supports for adolescents with more PTSD symptoms may reduce propensity for alcohol misuse following disaster. This information can be easily incorporated into existing web-based interventions.

Oxytocin receptor gene variant interacts with intervention delivery format in predicting intervention outcomes for youth with conduct problems.,"Glenn, Andrea L.; Lochman, John E.; Dishion, Thomas; Powell, Nicole P.; Boxmeyer, Caroline; Qu, Lixin","Coping Power is an evidence-based preventive intervention program for youth with aggressive behavior problems that has traditionally been delivered in small group formats. Because of concerns about iatrogenic effects secondary to aggregation of high risk youth, the current study examined whether genetic risk may moderate intervention outcome when youth were randomly assigned to group versus individual formats of an intervention. The oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) has been associated with social behavior and may influence susceptibility to social reinforcement in general and deviant peer influence in particular. One variant of OXTR (rs2268493) was examined in 197 fourth-grade African-American children (64% male) who were randomly assigned to Group Coping Power or Individual Coping Power (Lochman et al. 2015). Longitudinal assessments of teacher- and parent-reported behavior were collected through a 1-year follow-up. Growth curve analyses revealed a genotype by delivery format interaction. Youth with the A/A genotype demonstrated reductions in externalizing problems over the course of the intervention regardless of intervention format. In contrast, carriers of the G allele receiving the group-based intervention showed little improvement during the intervention and a worsening of symptoms during the follow-up year, while those receiving the individual format demonstrated reductions in externalizing problems. Given the associations between this OXTR variant and social bonding, carriers of the G allele may be more sensitive to social rewards from deviant peers in the group setting. This study suggests that genetic factors may be useful in predicting which type of intervention will be most effective for a particular individual.

Assessing the involvement of altered neurotensin signaling in anorexia nervosa.,"Schroeder, Laura Elizabeth","Assessing the Involvement of Altered Neurotensin Signaling in Anorexia Nervosa By Laura Elizabeth Schroeder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), characterized by a persistent and detrimental drive to lose weight via restriction of food intake and excessive exercise, is the psychiatric disorder with the highest mortality rate. Very few options exist when considering pharmacotherapies used to treat AN patients, and no drugs have been demonstrated to significantly improve weight gain. This highlights the need to not only find better drugbased therapies for AN but to also find druggable targets for this disorder. While AN is thought to be highly heritable, with heritability estimates ranging between 50--80%, it has been challenging to identify significant genetic contributors. Thus, determining the genetic risk factors of AN will first be required for development of better therapeutics. In an effort to better understand the genetic basis of AN, recent work has been performed to uncover rare genetic variants that confer high risk of disease development. Loss-of-function variants in Neurotensin (Nts) and Nts Receptor 1 (NtsR1) were identified in individuals with eating disorders. Nts is a neuropeptide known to regulate ingestive and locomotor behavior. Nts modulates these behaviors centrally, and a subset of dopamine (DA) neurons with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that coexpress NtsR1 are known to contribute to DA-mediated weight loss behaviors. Ablation of all NtsR1 VTA neurons was shown to promote excessive locomotor activity without a sufficient increase in feeding, leading to low body weight. Finally, increased fiber densities have been found within the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of individuals with AN, and the LHA is a region with a significant population of Nts neurons known to modulate both feeding and activity. We therefore hypothesized that Nts populations in feeding centers, such as the LHA, receive altered input from structures associated with AN and that alterations and/or disruption of Nts signaling promotes AN-like behaviors. This hypothesis was explored via three different approaches. First, the location and density of Nts populations within the brains of Nts Cre; Floxed GFP mice were mapped, and this revealed the presence of Nts in regions implicated in regulation of feeding and AN. The next approach involved determining if disrupted Nts signaling increases risk for development of AN-like behaviors. This was accomplished by characterizing NtsR1-deficient mice both at baseline and after exposure to an adolescent-stress model of AN. This study revealed that deficiency of NtsR1 is a genetic risk factor that, when interacting with risks of being female and exposure to adolescent stress, promotes aberrant feeding, excessive locomotor behaviors, and compulsive anxiety behaviors analogous to those observed in AN. Finally, a rabies virus-based method was used to identify direct inputs to LHA Nts neurons, and this highlighted the existence of afferents, and thus top-down control, from structures implicated in AN. In addition, densities of these inputs were determined in mouse models of AN, and this demonstrated that afferent inputs to LHA Nts neurons are increased from sites associated with AN. Altogether, the data presented in this thesis highlight the possible genetic and neurocircuitry alterations to the Nts-NtsR1 system that may promote and/or be the result of development of AN. These data also indicate the need for future studies to better understand the mechanism by which such alterations in Nts signaling promote this disease.

Gene by environment interaction and adaptive functioning in maltreated and nonmaltreated African American children: A structural equation mixture model.,"Thibodeau, Eric Lee","This study used a structural equation mixture model to test for an interaction between genetic variation and child maltreatment experiences predicting profiles of multi-domain adaptive functioning. Children aged 6- to 13-years ( N = 1004) were recruited to attend a research day camp. Half of the children were recruited based on substantiated maltreatment histories, the other half were non-maltreated but matched on socio-economic status. During the camp, saliva was collected and 12 genetic-variants known to confer environmental sensitivity (ES) were genotyped. Measures were of prosocial behavior, antisocial behavior, withdrawn behavior, and depression were also collected. These four indicators of adaptive functioning were used in a latent class analysis (LCA). A 4-class solution was selected as a best-fitting model. The four classes characterized 'well-adjusted', 'externalizing', 'internalizing', and 'socially-dominant' groups. The number of maltreatment subtypes experienced significantly predicted this latent class variable controlling for sex and age (Wald=35.3, df=3, p&lt;0.000). The 12 genetic-variants were formed into one formative factor. The interaction of this polygenic formative factor and the maltreatment variable (GxE) also significantly predicted the latent class variable controlling for sex, age, an age-by-maltreatment interaction term, and a sex-by-polygenic factor interaction term (Wald=13.5, df=3, p=0.004). Specifically, significant GxE odds ratios were present in the pairwise comparisons of membership in the externalizing class versus the well-adjusted class as well as the externalizing class versus the socially-dominant class. High genetic factor scores appeared to buffer the effects of maltreatment, thereby contributing to more resilient profiles of adaptive functioning.

It describes the growth and development of children from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project who were raised under adverse circumstances and followed from childhood into adulthood. The chapter explains the processes by which poverty and disadvantage work with other factors to create an environment that can lead to risk for mental health and psychiatric problems, and the transmission of risk and psychopathology across generations. Understanding transactional processes is necessary to more effectively intervene in the intergenerational cycle of both poverty and psychopathology. Through lack of social support, financial burden, and poor health, single parenthood also increases levels of stress and psychiatric problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Parenting is one suggested mechanism that may interact with genetic risk in the transmission of mental disorder from one generation to the next. The chapter highlights the fact that the experience of emotional and behavioral problems in childhood among at-risk populations is associated with continued problems in adolescence.

This has now been corrected in both the PDF and HTML versions of this article. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-39753-001[/rid]). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a severely impairing neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 5% in children and adolescents and of 2.5% in adults. Comorbid conditions in ADHD play a key role in symptom progression, disorder course and outcome. ADHD is associated with a significantly increased risk for substance use, abuse and dependence. ADHD and cannabis use are partly determined by genetic factors; the heritability of ADHD is estimated at 70–80% and of cannabis use initiation at 40–48%. In this study, we used summary statistics from the largest available meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD (<i>n</i> = 53,293) and lifetime cannabis use (<i>n</i> = 32,330) to gain insights into the genetic overlap and causal relationship of these two traits. We estimated their genetic correlation to be <i>r</i>² = 0.29 (<i>P</i> = 1.63 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci in a cross-trait analysis: two in a single variant association analysis (rs145108385, <i>P</i> = 3.30 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and rs4259397, <i>P</i> = 4.52 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) and two in a gene-based association analysis (WDPCP, <i>P</i> = 9.67 × 10<sup>−7</sup> and ZNF251, <i>P</i> = 1.62 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach we found support that ADHD is causal for lifetime cannabis use, with an odds ratio of 7.9 for cannabis use in individuals with ADHD in comparison to individuals without ADHD (95% CI (3.72, 15.51), <i>P</i> = 5.88 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). These results substantiate the temporal relationship between ADHD and future cannabis use and reinforce the need to consider substance misuse in the context of ADHD in clinical interventions.

Negative urgency mediates the relation between genetically influenced serotonin functioning and alcohol problems.,"Wang, Frances L.; Chassin, Laurie","Serotonin (5-HT) functioning is associated with alcohol problems. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. In the current study the authors tested whether five separate dimensions of impulsivity (UPPS-P) mediated the relation between a polygenic score indexing 5-HT functioning and alcohol problems and whether any of these paths were moderated by age. Results showed that a 5-HT polygenic score predicted alcohol problems indirectly through negative urgency, but not any other facet of impulsivity. The 5-HT polygenic score also directly predicted alcohol problems. No age moderation was found. Findings suggest that negative urgency might be one important mechanism underlying the relation between genetically influenced 5-HT functioning and alcohol problems. However, genetically influenced 5-HT functioning likely influences alcohol problems through additional mechanisms. More broadly, results suggest that the previously observed transdiagnostic nature of 5-HT functioning on diverse types of psychopathology might be, in part, explained by its effect on negative urgency.

Genetic influences on conduct disorder.,"Salvatore, Jessica E.; Dick, Danielle M.","Conduct disorder (CD) is a moderately heritable psychiatric disorder of childhood and adolescence characterized by aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules.

A small number of candidate genes (e.g., <i>GABRA2</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>AVPR1A</i>) are associated with CD related phenotypes across independent studies; however, failures to replicate also exist. Studies of gene-environment interplay show that CD genetic predispositions also contribute to selection into higher-risk environments, and that environmental factors can alter the importance of CD genetic factors and differentially methylate CD candidate genes. The field’s understanding of CD etiology will benefit from larger, adequately powered studies in gene identification efforts; the incorporation of polygenic approaches in gene-environment interplay studies; attention to the mechanisms of risk from genes to brain to behavior; and the use of genetically informative data to test quasi-causal hypotheses about purported risk factors.

"Examining the relationship among genes, attention bias to emotion, and depression in youth.","Jenness, Jessica L.","The investigation of biologically initiated pathways to psychological disorder is critical to advance our understanding of mental illness. Research has suggested that attention bias to emotion may be an intermediate trait for depression associated with biologically plausible candidate genes, such as the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) and catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) genes, yet there have been mixed findings in regards to the precise direction of effects. The experience of recent stressful life events (SLEs) may be an important, yet currently unstudied, moderator of the relationship between genes and attention bias as SLEs have been associated with both gene expression and attention to emotion. Additionally, although attention biases to emotion have been studied as a possible intermediate trait associated with depression, no study has examined whether attention biases within the context of measured genetic risk lead to increased risk for clinical depressive episodes over time. Therefore, this research investigated both whether SLEs moderate the link between genetic risk (5-HTTLPR and COMT) and attention bias to emotion and whether 5-HTTLPR and COMT moderated the relationship between attention biases to emotional faces and clinical depression onset prospectively across 18 months within a large community sample of youth (n = 467). Analyses revealed a differential effect of gene. Youth who were homozygous for the low expressing allele of 5-HTTLPR (S/S) and had experienced more recent SLEs within the last three months demonstrated preferential attention toward negative emotional faces (angry and sad). However, youth who were homozygous for the high expressing COMT genotype (Val/Val) and had experienced more recent SLEs showed attentional avoidance of positive facial expressions (happy). Additionally, youth who avoided negative emotion (i.e., anger) and were homozygous for the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene were at greater risk for prospective depressive episode onset. Increased risk for depression onset was specific to the 5-HTTLPR gene and was not found when examining moderation by COMT. These findings highlight the importance of examining risk for depression across multiple levels of analysis, such as combined genetic, environmental, and cognitive risk, and is the first study to demonstrate clear evidence of attention biases to emotion functioning as an intermediate trait predicting depression.

Using a large epidemiological sample ascertained via public registries, is it possible to identify clinical and historical features of AUD that reflect familial risk? Methods: Using registration in national medical, legal or pharmacy registries, we identified four kinds of relative pairs (n = 683,223) starting with a proband with AUD: cousins, half-siblings, full-siblings and monozygotic cotwins. Using linear hazard regression, we examined the interaction between five clinical/historical features of AUD in the proband and risk for AUD in these relatives. Results: Increased risk for AUD in relatives was predicted by the proband’s early age at first registration, total number of registrations, recurrence, history of drug abuse and ascertainment in the medical versus the legal or pharmacy registry. In multivariate models, age at first registration, number of registrations, recurrence and history of drug abuse remained significant and in aggregate strongly predicted the risk for AUD in relatives. The risk for AUD in siblings of AUD probands in the highest decile of genetic risk predicted by these four indices was more than twice as great as that predicted in siblings of probands in the lowest risk decile.

Variation in GABRA2 was associated with an increase in drunkenness that occurred at the transition between adolescence and adulthood. The genotypic effect was more pronounced in females. These analyses illustrate the importance of longitudinal data to characterize how genetic effects unfold across development. The findings suggest that transitions across important developmental periods may alter the relative importance of genetic effects on patterns of alcohol use.

Cumulative genetic and environmental predictors of youth substance use.,"Carrano, Jennifer L.","Substance abuse and dependence are among the nation's leading health issues, leading to more illnesses, disabilities, and deaths than any other modifiable health condition. Substance use among youth is of particular concern, as rates are higher than among any other age group and because early use is associated with a higher risk of later abuse and dependence and a higher incidence of related risk-taking behavior. Thus, a better understanding of the causes of substance use problems is a central issue. The primary goal of this study was to examine genetic and environmental predictors of youth alcohol and drug abuse and dependence. This study expands upon extant research by being the first to utilize a genetic risk score (GRS) approach to examine the joint effect of four dopaminergic genetic polymorphisms on substance abuse and dependence, by incorporating cumulative measures of environmental risk and promotive factors, and by examining gene-environment interactions (GxEs) and gender differences in substance use predictors, thus allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of environmental and genetic influences than has previously been attempted. Analyses were conducted on a national longitudinal sample of 1,396 Caucasian youth who participated in surveys and DNA sampling in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, with individuals followed from adolescence (ages 12-18) into early adulthood (ages 24-32). Logistic regression analyses examined main and interactive effects of cumulative environmental risk and promotive factors and genetic risk scores on clinically significant alcohol and drug abuse and dependence in early adulthood. Analyses were conducted separately for males and females to examine gender differences in substance use predictors. Results show that a dopaminergic GRS index significantly predicted the likelihood that female, but not male, youth will meet clinical criteria for substance abuse and dependence, even after accounting for cumulative environmental influences. No evidence of GxE was found. These results provide a better understanding of the etiology of substance abuse and dependence and provide evidence of the utility of GRS methods for studying genetic influences on substance use behaviors.

Anxiety can be debilitating, affecting children's functioning with peers, school, and recreation. It is, therefore, important to understand how these difficulties develop. One way of increasing understanding of the etiology of anxiety is to investigate its genetic and environmental influences. Research in this field has moved away from simply estimating the level of genetic and environmental influences on anxiety to considering more complex issues, including the extent to which genetic (and environmental) influences are common across disorders (for example anxiety and depression), how these influences might change over time, and how genes and environment interact. This chapter provides an overview of quantitative and molecular genetic research in this area. We present a series of analyses which combine multiple methods and include assessment of genetic risks, cognitive vulnerability, and environmental stress on the development of anxiety.

Nevertheless, the identification of such variants has so far been limited to preselected candidate genes. In this study we extended the differential susceptibility hypothesis from a candidate gene to a genome-wide approach to test whether a polygenic score of environmental sensitivity predicted response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in children with anxiety disorders. Methods: We identified variants associated with environmental sensitivity using a novel method in which within-pair variability in emotional problems in 1,026 monozygotic twin pairs was examined as a function of the pairs' genotype. We created a polygenic score of environmental sensitivity based on the whole-genome findings and tested the score as a moderator of parenting on emotional problems in 1,406 children and response to individual, group and brief parent-led CBT in 973 children with anxiety disorders. Results: The polygenic score significantly moderated the effects of parenting on emotional problems and the effects of treatment. Individuals with a high score responded significantly better to individual CBT than group CBT or brief parent-led CBT (remission rates: 70.9, 55.5 and 41.6%, respectively). Conclusions: Pending successful replication, our results should be considered exploratory.

The following attribution should have appeared in the acknowledgements section: “Dr. Pappa and Ms. Fedko are co-first authors of this article.”] Objective: Genetic factors contribute to individual differences in behavior problems. In children, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded the first suggestive results when aiming to identify genetic variants that explain heritability, but the proportion of genetic variance that can be attributed to common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remains to be determined, as only a few studies have estimated SNP heritability, with diverging results. Method: Genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) as implemented in the software Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate SNP heritability (SNP <i>h²</i>) for multiple phenotypes within 4 broad domains of children’s behavioral problems (attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms, internalizing, externalizing, and pervasive developmental problems) and cognitive function. We combined phenotype and genotype data from 2 independent, population-based Dutch cohorts, yielding a total number of 1,495 to 3,175 of 3-, 7-, and 9-year-old children. Results: Significant SNP heritability estimates were found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms (SNP <i>h²</i> = 0.37–0.71), externalizing problems (SNP <i>h²</i> = 0.44), and total problems (SNP <i>h²</i> = 0.18), rated by mother or teacher. Sensitivity analyses with exclusion of extreme cases and quantile normalization of the phenotype data decreased SNP <i>h²</i> as expected under genetic inheritance, but they remained statistically significant for most phenotypes. Conclusion: We provide evidence of the influence of common SNPs on child behavior problems in an ethnically homogenous sample. These results support the continuation of large GWAS collaborative efforts to unravel the genetic basis of complex child behaviors.

Evidence that the gene–environment interactions underlying youth conduct problems vary across development.,"Burt, S. Alexandra","Gene–environment interactions (G × E) are thought to constitute a core mechanism through which genes influence youth conduct problems. Although biometric G × E studies have yielded provocative leads, two interrelated issues have yet to be meaningfully considered. First, most work has been focused on the diathesis‐stress model of G × E, in which genetic risk is amplified following exposure to an environmental pathogen. Although this form of G × E appears to be important, other possible instantiations of G × E exist. For example, in bioecological G × E, deleterious environments amplify environmental influences on the outcome. Second, conduct problems change dramatically from childhood to adolescence in that high levels of physical aggression give way to high levels of nonaggressive delinquency. As such, researchers must consider development to understand G × E. I consider both of these issues in relation to one another to encourage additional research on the development of G × E.

Parental cancer.,"Moore, Cynthia W.; Rauch, Paula K.","Parenting is challenging in the best of circumstances. Parenting while managing the physical and emotional tolls on each family member imposed by a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, poses challenges that can feel overwhelming to children and adults.

An extended Swedish national adoption study of alcohol use disorder.,"Kendler, Kenneth S.; Ji, Jianguang; Edwards, Alexis C.; Ohlsson, Henrik; Sundquist, Jan; Sundquist, Kristina","IMPORTANCE: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) runs strongly in families. It is unclear to what extent the cross-generational transmission of AUD results from genetic vs environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk for AUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Follow-up in 8 public data registers of adoptees, their biological and adoptive relatives, and offspring and parents from stepfamilies and not-lived-with families in Sweden. In this cohort study, subtypes of AUD were assessed by latent class analysis. A total of 18 115 adoptees (born 1950-1993) and 171 989 and 107 696 offspring of not-lived-with parents and stepparents, respectively (born 1960-1993). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alcohol use disorder recorded in medical, legal, or pharmacy registry records. RESULTS: Alcohol use disorder in adoptees was significantly predicted by AUD in biological parents (odds ratio, 1.46; 95%CI, 1.29-1.66) and siblings (odds ratio, 1.94; 95%CI, 1.55-2.44) as well as adoptive parents (odds ratio, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.09-1.80). Genetic and environmental risk indices created from biological and adoptive relatives acted additively on adoptee AUD liability. Results from biological and adoptive relatives were replicated and extended from examinations of, respectively, not-lived-with parents and stepparents. Multivariate models in these families showed that AUD in offspring was significantly predicted by AUD, drug abuse, psychiatric illness, and crime in not-lived-with parents and by AUD, drug abuse, crime, and premature death in stepparents. Latent class analyses of adoptees and offspring of not-lived-with parents with AUDs revealed 3 AUD classes characterized by (1) female preponderance and high rates of psychiatric illness, (2) mild nonrecurrent symptoms, and (3) early-onset recurrence, drug abuse, and crime. These classes had distinct genetic signatures in the patterns of risk for various disorders in their not-lived-with parents and striking differences in the rates of recorded mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parent-offspring transmission of AUD results from both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic risk for AUD reflects both a specific liability to AUD and to other externalizing disorders. Environmental risk reflects features of both parental psychopathology and other aspects of the rearing environment. Alcohol use disorder is a heterogeneous syndrome and meaningful subtypes emerged from latent class analysis, which were validated by patterns of disorders in biological parents and specific psychiatric comorbidities. The general population contains informative family constellations that can complement more traditional adoption designs in clarifying the sources of parent-offspring resemblance.

Environmental and genetic determinants of childhood depression: The roles of <i>DAT1</i> and the antenatal environment.,"D'Souza, Stephanie; Thompson, John M.

Additionally, few studies have investigated whether stressors occurring very early in development moderate the influence of certain genes on depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from monoaminergic genes interacted with measures of early life stress to influence depressive symptoms in children. Participants were members of the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative cohort. Small for gestational age (SGA) and maternal stress during pregnancy were measured at birth and used as indicators of early life stress. At age 11, depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) and DNA samples were collected for genotyping. A two-way ANOVA revealed that SGA and a SNP from the dopamine transporter gene <i>DAT1</i> had an interactive effect on children's depressive symptoms. Specifically, symptoms were greater in children born SGA who are T homozygous for the rs1042098 SNP. These findings suggest that adverse intrauterine environments leading to low birth weight also seem to exacerbate the effects of certain <i>DAT1</i> variants on depression.

BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and plasma levels in Chinese Han population with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.,"Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Haiyin; Li, Ying; Wang, Zhen; Fan, Qing; Yu, Shunying; Lin, Zhiguang; Xiao, Zeping","Background: Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, which include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) used to be categorized as anxiety disorder in DSM-IV. However OCD was no longer included in anxiety disorders and came into its own category titled as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD) in DSM-5. It will be interesting to explore is there any different biological characteristics between OCD and anxiety disorders. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a potential candidate gene in both OCD and GAD. The results of genetic association studies between BDNF and OCD have been inconsistent. BDNF plasma/serum levels in OCD have been found lower than those in healthy controls. However the heritable reason of the lowered BDNF levels was not well elucidated. The amount of studies about BDNF and GAD were relatively small. The aims of this study were to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphism Val66Met of BDNF was associated with OCD and GAD, to examine BDNF plasma levels in OCD and GAD, and to explore whether Val66Met variation influences BDNF plasma levels. Methods: We genotyped Val66Met variation in 148 OCD patients, 108 GAD patients and 99 healthy controls. Within the same sample, BDNF plasma levels were determined in 113 OCD patients, 102 GAD patients and 63 healthy controls. Results: Val66Met variation was not associated with OCD or GAD. BDNF plasma levels in OCD and GAD patients were significant lower than those in healthy controls. Val66Met variation had no influence on BDNF plasma levels. No difference was found between OCD and GAD. Results do not change no matter taking OCD and GAD as one group or separated two. Limitations: First, the sample size for genotyping was relatively small, which leaded to a low statistical power of the genetic part in this study. Second, we genotyped just one SNP in BDNF gene. Third, parts of the participants did not be assayed for BDNF plasma levels. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF is involved in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, not only OCD but also GAD. OCD and GAD patients both show lower BDNF plasma levels compared to healthy controls. The BDNF plasma levels are not associated with Val66Met variation.

In a previous investigation of a large population cohort, impaired ‘emotional/social cognitive’ processing, assessed by questionnaire, was observed to mediate the link between <i>COMT Val158Met</i> and aggression in individuals with ADHD. We set out to replicate and extend this finding in a clinical sample, using task-based and physiological assessments of emotional and cognitive processing. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that directly assessed emotional processing mediates the link between <i>COMT Val158Met</i> and aggression in young people with ADHD. Methods: Males aged 10–17 years with ADHD were recruited from UK community clinics (<i>n</i> = 194). Research diagnostic interviews (parent and child) were used to assess psychopathology and generate DSM-IV Conduct Disorder symptom scores. Participants completed tasks assessing executive function (response inhibition and set shifting), empathy for fear, sadness and happiness, and fear conditioning [measured using skin conductance responses (SCR) to aversive stimuli]. Results: <i>COMT Val</i> allele carriers showed poorer response inhibition (<i>F</i> = 5.27, <i>p</i> = .02) and set shifting abilities (<i>F</i> = 6.45, <i>p</i> = .01), reduced fear empathy (<i>F</i> = 4.33, <i>p</i> = .04) and reduced autonomic responsiveness (lower SCRs) to the conditioned aversive stimulus (<i>F</i> = 11.74, <i>p</i> = .001). <i>COMT Val158Met</i> did not predict impairments in recognising others’ emotions or affective empathy for happiness or sadness. Mediation analysis revealed that impaired fear-related mechanisms indirectly mediated the link between <i>COMT Val158Met</i> and aggression. Conclusion: Our findings suggest fear mechanisms as possible targets for psychological interventions to disrupt links between genetic risk and aggressive outcomes in ADHD. Our findings also reveal the potential of hypothesis-driven approaches for identifying neuropsychological mechanisms that mediate genetic risk effects on behaviour and psychopathology.

Gendering genetics: Biological contingencies in the protective effects of social integration for men and women.,"Perry, Brea L.","Evidence that social and biological processes are intertwined in producing health and human behavior is rapidly accumulating. Using a feminist approach, this research explores how gender moderates the interaction between biological processes and men’s and women’s behavioral and emotional responses to similar social environments. Using data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, the influence of gender, social integration, and genetic risk on nicotine and alcohol dependence is examined. Three-way interaction models reveal gender-specific moderation of interactions between genetic risk score and social integration. Namely, being currently married and reporting positive social psychological integration are predictive of reduced risk of nicotine dependence among men with genetic susceptibility to strong nicotine cravings in the presence of social cues like stress. In contrast, the protective effects of marital status and social integration are substantially attenuated and absent, respectively, among women with high-risk genotypes. This pattern reflects the dualism (i.e., simultaneous costs and benefits) inherent in social integration for women, which may disproportionately affect those with a genetic sensitivity to stress. These findings contest the notion of genotype as static biological hardwiring that is independent from social and cultural systems of gender difference.

Using linear hazard regression, we examined the interaction between three clinical features of DA in the proband and risk for DA in these four relative pairs, ordered by degree of genetic relationship. Results: Increased risk for DA in relatives was robustly predicted by early age at first registration, total number of registrations, and ascertainment in the criminal<i> versus</i> the medical or pharmacy registry. In multivariate models, all three of these variables remained significant and in aggregate strongly predicted DA risk in relatives. The risk for DA in siblings of DA probands in the highest decile of genetic risk predicted by our three indices was more than twice as great as that predicted in siblings of probands in the lowest decile of risk.

Whole‐brain analyses were conducted for fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) to examine associations between <i>NOS1</i> and WM microstructure, including possible interactions with gender and diagnosis. Results: Consistent with previous literature, <i>NOS1</i>‐ex1f was associated with total ADHD and hyperactivity‐impulsivity symptoms, but not inattention; this effect was independent of gender. <i>NOS1</i>‐ex1f was also associated with MD values in several major WM tracts in females, but not males.

Stress-vulnerability model of suicidal behaviours.,"Wasserman, Danuta; Sokolowski, Marcus","The causes of suicide are complex and multifactorial, and it is today clear that no simple explanations are to be found. Given the complexity, a variety of study-models to explain the origins of suicidal behaviours have been presented which tend to focus on particular explanatory domains e.g., psychiatric, psychological, or social. In those models, one particular component has often been regarded as dominant for aetiology; for example, that given enough stressful life events almost anyone would develop psychopathology or suicidality. But nowadays, a more comprehensive stress-vulnerability model is mainly used and accepted, introduced by Mann and Arango into suicidology. Here, one instead also takes into account the fact that a current acute stressor (‘state’)—for example, an ongoing psychiatric illness or recent traumatic life experience—is neither sufficient nor necessary for suicide to occur. For example, although most suicides happen in the context of depression, only a few per cent of depressed are suicidal. This is also valid for exposure to stressful life events such as loss of a loved one, which affects people differently in the same manner. It is instead reasoned that a trait-like characteristic (‘stress-vulnerability’) must also be present, which pushes certain individuals to engage in suicidal behaviours in situations when most others do not. Such a constitutional predisposition (a ‘trait’ or ‘diathesis’) for suicide is thought to be formed (or ‘developed’) due to the influence of inborn genetic risks which combine with stressful life experiences, trauma, illnesses, or even drugs during childhood and adolescence. The challenge lies in understanding how such a trait-like ‘suicidal brain’ is formed and how it might manifest itself in adulthood prior to suicide. Current research combines sociological, psychological, and neurobiological (including genetic) study perspectives into increasingly refined formulations of the stress-vulnerability model, and this also makes prevention of, or intervention against, suicidal behaviours relevant across the entire life span and not only during acute suicidal crises.

"A population-based Swedish Twin and Sibling study of cannabis, stimulant and sedative abuse in men.","Kendler, Kenneth S.; Ohlsson, Henrik; Maes, Hermine H.; Sundquist, Kristina; Lichtenstein, Paul; Sundquist, Jan","Background: Prior studies, utilizing interview-based assessments, suggest that most of the genetic risk factors for drug abuse (DA) are non-specific with a minority acting specifically on risk for abuse of particular psychoactive substance classes. We seek to replicate these findings using objective national registry data. Methods: We examined abuse of cannabis, stimulants (including cocaine) and sedatives ascertained from national Swedish registers in male–male monozygotic (1720 pairs) and dizygotic twins (1219 pairs) combined with near-age full siblings (76,457 pairs) to provide sufficient power. Modeling was performed using Mx. Results: A common pathway model fitted better than an independent pathway model. The latent liability to DA was highly heritable but also influenced by shared environment. Cannabis, stimulant and sedative abuse all loaded strongly on the common factor. Estimates for the total heritability for the three forms of substance abuse ranged from 64 to 70%. Between 75 and 90% of that genetic risk was non-specific, coming from the common factor with the remainder deriving from substance specific genetic risk factors. By contrast, all of the shared environmental effects, which accounted for 18–20% of the variance in liability, were non-specific. Conclusions: In accord with prior studies based on personal interviews, the large preponderance of genetic risk factors for abuse of specific classes of psychoactive substance are non-specific. These results suggest that genetic variation in the primary sites of action of the psychoactive drugs, which differ widely across most drug classes, play a minor role in human individual differences in risk for DA.

Genetic risk factors for substance use during adolescence.,"Lightdale, Hallie A.","The past 20 years have seen elucidation of many ""biological"" aspects of substance use and substance dependence, especially findings on neuronal circuits and abnormal neuroanatomy. Genetic understanding is another perspective—an important and powerful one—that has also developed in this period.While it could be argued that familial patterns of addiction are affected by a variety of social and environmental factors, twin studies have demonstrated that considerable variability in risk for developing addiction is due to genetics. What is meant, then, by ""genetics?"" We may refer to ""genetic factors"" as the qualities transmitted through genes and chromosomes, and those components may be differentiated from the impact of the family as a social unit affecting the individual's use, or the genetic influences upon the production of various psychiatric disorders or upon the development of various medical or neurological conditions. While all of these factors may have genetic components, they have not been analyzed in terms of their risk for substance use. This chapter generalizes among substances only when warranted.

Obtaining genetic testing in pediatric epilepsy.,"Ream, Margie A.; Patel, Anup D.","The steps from patient evaluation to genetic diagnosis remain complicated. We discuss some of the genetic testing methods available along with their general advantages and disadvantages. We briefly review common pediatric epilepsy syndromes with strong genetic association and provide a potentially useful algorithm for genetic testing in drug‐resistant epilepsy. We performed an extensive literature review of available information as it pertains to genetic testing and genetics in pediatric epilepsy. If a genetic disorder is suspected as the cause of epilepsy, based on drug resistance, family history, or clinical phenotype, timely diagnosis may reduce overall cost, limit the diagnostic odyssey that can bring much anxiety to families, improve prognostic accuracy, and lead to targeted therapy. Interpretation of complicated results should be performed only in collaboration with geneticists and genetic counselors, unless the ordering neurologist has a strong background in and understanding of genetics. Genetic testing can play an important role in the care provided to patients with epilepsy.

We investigated the association of genetic variants in two schizophrenia candidate genes with executive function (EF) and IQ in 22q11.2DS individuals. Ninety two individuals with 22q11.2 deletion were studied for the genetic association between <i>COMT</i> and <i>PRODH</i> variants and EF and IQ.

The association between the catechol-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase Val108/158Met polymorphism and hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms in youth.,"Perkovic, Matea Nikolac; Kiive, Evelyn; Erjavec, Gordana Nedic; Veidebaum, Toomas; Curkovic, Mario; Dodig-Curkovic, Katarina; Muck-Seler, Dorotea; Harro, Jaanus; Pivac, Nela","Rationale: Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention are major symptoms occurring in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This disorder is highly heritable, multifactorial, polygenic, and associated primarily with dysfunctions of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems. Objectives: The present study tested the possible association of the catechol-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase (COMT) Val108/158Met (rs4680) polymorphism with hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms in male youth. Method: Polymorphism COMT Val108/158Met was analyzed in 807 male unrelated Caucasian young subjects: 231 healthy controls, 195 subjects with moderate hyperactive symptoms and 254 subjects with moderate inattentive symptoms, 111 subjects with severe hyperactive symptoms and 90 subjects with severe inattentive symptoms, all evaluated using Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire IV criteria. Results: The frequency of the COMT genotypes, alleles, and the homozygous Met/Met genotype versus Val carriers (χ² test with standardized residuals) differed significantly between subjects without and subjects with hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms. In addition, significantly higher hyperactive– impulsive and inattentive scores were found in subjects with the Met/Met genotype compared to carriers of other COMT genotypes. These significant results were due to the more frequent occurrence of Met/Met genotype or the Met allele in subjects with moderate and severe hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms compared to matched controls. Conclusion: These results suggest that the Met/Met genotype or the Met allele of the COMT Val108/158Met, contributing to higher dopaminergic activity, are significantly overrepresented in subjects with moderate or severe hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms, and that this polymorphism is significantly associated with hyperactive–impulsive and inattentive symptoms in young boys and adolescents.

Course of cannabis use and clinical outcome in patients with non-affective psychosis: A 3-year follow-up study.,"van der Meer, F.

The current study examined whether (1) persistent, recently started, discontinued and non-cannabis-using patients with a psychotic disorder differed with regard to illness outcome at 3-year follow-up, and (2) whether timing of cannabis discontinuation was associated with course of clinical outcome. Method: This 3-year follow-up study was part of a multi-center study in the Netherlands and Belgium (Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis; GROUP). We used mixed-model analyses to investigate the association between pattern of cannabis use and symptoms, global functioning and psychotic relapse. Results: In our sample of 678 patients, we found persistent users to have more positive and general symptoms, worse global functioning and more psychotic relapses compared with non-users and discontinued users [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; PANSS general, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) symptoms, <i>p</i> = 0.017; GAF disability, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; relapses,<i> p</i> = 0.038]. Patients who started using cannabis after study onset were characterized by worse functioning at baseline and showed an increase in general symptoms (including depression and anxiety) at the 3-year follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Timing of cannabis discontinuation was not associated with clinical outcome. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cannabis use in patients with a psychotic disorder has a long-lasting negative effect on illness outcome, particularly when persistent.

Changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety from middle adolescence to early adulthood.,"Garcia, Sarah E.; Tully, Erin C.; Tarantino, Nicholas; South, Susan; Iacono, William G.; McGue, Matt","Background: Middle adolescence to early adulthood is an important developmental period for the emergence of anxiety. Genetically-influenced stable traits are thought to underlie internalizing psychopathology throughout development, but no studies have examined changes in genetic and environmental influences on trait anxiety during this period. Method: A longitudinal twin study design was used to study same-sex twin pairs (485 monozygotic pairs, 271 dizygotic pairs) at three ages, 14, 18, and 21 years, to examine developmental shifts in genetic and environmental effects on trait anxiety. Results: The heritability of trait anxiety increased with age, particularly between ages 14 and 18, no significant new genetic influences emerged after age 14, and the genetic influences were highly correlated across the three ages, supporting developmentally stable genetic risk factors. The environmental effects shared by members of a family decreased in influence across adolescence, while the influence of environmental effects unique to each individual twin remained relatively stable over the course of development and were largely age-specific. Limitations: The twin study design does not inform about specific genes and environmental risk factors. Conclusions: Genetic influences increased in importance from middle to late adolescence but common genetic factors influenced trait anxiety across the three ages. Shared environmental influences decreased in importance and demonstrated negligible influence by late adolescence/early adulthood. Nonshared environmental effects were almost entirely age-specific. These findings support the importance of developmentally-sensitive interventions that target shared environmental factors prior to middle adolescence and shifting non-shared environmental risks at each age.

Neighborhood disadvantage alters the origins of children’s nonaggressive conduct problems.,"Burt, S. Alexandra; Klump, Kelly L.; Gorman-Smith, Deborah; Neiderhiser, Jenae M.","Neighborhood disadvantage plays a pivotal role in child mental health, including child antisocial behavior (e.g., lying, theft, vandalism; assault, cruelty). Prior studies have indicated that shared environmental influences on youth antisocial behavior increase with increasing disadvantage, but researchers have been unable to confirm that these findings persist once various selection confounds are considered. In the current study, we sought to fill this gap in the literature by examining whether and how neighborhood disadvantage alters the genetic and environmental origins of child antisocial behavior. Our sample consisted of 2,054 child twins participating in the Michigan State University Twin Registry, half of whom were oversampled to reside in modestly-to-severely impoverished neighborhoods. We made use of an innovative set of nuclear twin family models, thereby allowing us to disambiguate between, and simultaneously estimate, multiple elements of the shared environment as well as genetic influences. Although there was no evidence that the etiology of aggressive antisocial behavior was moderated by neighborhood disadvantage, the etiology of nonaggressive antisocial behavior shifted dramatically with increasing neighborhood disadvantage. Sibling-level shared environmental influences were estimated to be near zero in the wealthiest neighborhoods and increased dramatically in the most impoverished neighborhoods. By contrast, both genetic risk and family-level shared environmental transmission were significantly more influential in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods than in impoverished neighborhoods. Such results collectively highlight the profound role that pervasive neighborhood poverty plays in shaping the etiology of child nonaggressive antisocial behavior. Implications are discussed.

Who is afraid of math?

In particular, mathematical anxiety has attracted recent attention because of its damaging psychological effects and potential associations with mathematical problem solving and achievement. This study investigated the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the observed differences in the anxiety people feel when confronted with mathematical tasks. In addition, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that link mathematical anxiety with math cognition and general anxiety were also explored. Methods Univariate and multivariate quantitative genetic models were conducted in a sample of 514 12‐year‐old twin siblings. Results Genetic factors accounted for roughly 40% of the variation in mathematical anxiety, with the remaining being accounted for by child‐specific environmental factors. Multivariate genetic analyses suggested that mathematical anxiety was influenced by the genetic and nonfamilial environmental risk factors associated with general anxiety and additional independent genetic influences associated with math‐based problem solving. Conclusions The development of mathematical anxiety may involve not only exposure to negative experiences with mathematics, but also likely involves genetic risks related to both anxiety and math cognition. These results suggest that integrating cognitive and affective domains may be particularly important for mathematics and may extend to other areas of academic achievement.

Rare genomic variants link bipolar disorder with anxiety disorders to CREB-regulated intracellular signaling pathways.,"Kerner, Berit; Rao, Aliz R.; Christensen, Bryce; Dandekar, Sugandha; Yourshaw, Michael; Nelson, Stanley F.","Bipolar disorder is a common, complex, and severe psychiatric disorder with cyclical disturbances of mood and a high suicide rate. Here, we describe a family with four siblings, three affected females and one unaffected male.The disease course was characterized by early-onset bipolar disorder and co-morbid anxiety spectrum disorders that followed the onset of bipolar disorder. Genetic risk factors were suggested by the early onset of the disease, the severe disease course, including multiple suicide attempts, and lack of adverse prenatal or early life events. In particular, drug and alcohol abuse did not contribute to the disease onset. Exome sequencing identified very rare, heterozygous, and likely protein-damaging variants in eight brain-expressed genes: IQUB, JMJD1C, GADD45A, GOLGB1, PLSCR5, VRK2, MESDC2, and FGGY.The variants were shared among all three affected family members but absent in the unaffected sibling and in more than 200 controls.The genes encode proteins with significant regulatory roles in the ERK/MAPK and CREB-regulated intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways are central to neuronal and synaptic plasticity, cognition, affect regulation and response to chronic stress. In addition, proteins in these pathways are the target of commonly used mood-stabilizing drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and valproic acid.The combination of multiple rare, damaging mutations in these central pathways could lead to reduced resilience and increased vulnerability to stressful life events. Our results support a new model for psychiatric disorders, in which multiple rare, damaging mutations in genes functionally related to a common signaling pathway contribute to the manifestation of bipolar disorder.

The goal of this study was to identify and analyze phenotypes based on homogeneous classes of individuals to increase the power to detect genetic risk factors contributing to the risk of AD. Methods: The 7 individual DSM‐IV criteria for AD were analyzed using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify classes defined by the pattern of endorsement of the criteria. A genome‐wide association study was performed in 118 extended European American families (<i>n</i> = 2,322 individuals) densely affected with AD to identify genes associated with AD, with each of the 7 DSM‐IV criteria, and with the probability of belonging to 2 of 3 latent classes.

Traditional methods for estimating RTisv lose information regarding response times (RTs) distribution along the task, with eventual effects on statistical power. Ex-Gaussian analysis captures the dynamic nature of RTisv, estimating normal and exponential components for RT distribution, with specific phenomenological correlates. Here, we applied ex-Gaussian analysis to explore whether intra-individual variability of RTs agrees with criteria proposed by Gottesman and Gould for endophenotypes. Specifically, we evaluated if normal and/or exponential components of RTs may (a) present the stair-like distribution expected for endophenotypes (ADHD &gt; siblings &gt; typically developing children (TD) without familiar history of ADHD) and (b) represent a phenotypic correlate for previously described genetic risk variants.

The problem of substance abuse in people with schizophrenia.,"DeLisi, Lynn E.; Fleischhacker, W. Wolfgang","This editorial discusses the problem of substance abuse in people with schizophrenia. There is extensive literature showing that patients with schizophrenia who were heavy marijuana users prior to developing schizophrenia have an earlier age of illness onset and an association of the age at onset of cannabis use with the age at onset of psychosis. When users continue to abuse marijuana after onset of a psychotic illness, they have a worsened outcome. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that marijuana by itself when used in adolescence can increase one’s risk of later developing schizophrenia in a dose-dependent fashion, thus suggesting that in some individuals, it is actually causative. It remains controversial as to whether this increased risk is associated with a genetic risk of schizophrenia or a gene–environment interaction. The hypothesis is that marijuana may specifically have an effect on adolescent brain development and thus create an abnormal trajectory of higher cortical structural differentiation, particularly in the frontal and limbic cortices that could lead to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Future studies need to clearly examine the content of marijuana patients use and also how each component interacts with genetic risk factors to produce a psychotic illness.

The dynamic influence of genes and environment in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety.,"Creswell, Cathy; Waite, Polly","Comments on the article by Thalia C. Eley et al.

The combination of high prevalence, pervasive impairment, and a high degree of persistence and comorbidity means that anxiety disorders have a greater economic burden than any other mental health disorder. Anxiety disorders have an earlier onset than most other mental health disorders, with a median age at onset of 11 years, and over one-half of adults with an anxiety disorder will have met diagnostic criteria in their youth. The findings by the author are entirely consistent with models of the intergenerational transmission of affective disorder that suggest that living with a parent with an affective disorder does not only entail a genetic risk but may also increase exposure to potential environmental risk factors. The study by the author is emblematic of the application of increasingly sophisticated designs that allow for the identification of complex developmental differences in mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of anxiety, providing critical information to guide more nuanced approaches to prevention and treatment.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-14902-027[/rid]). Learning to respond to others' distress with well-regulated empathy is an important developmental task linked to positive health outcomes and moral achievements. However, this important interpersonal skill set may also confer risk for depression and anxiety when present at extreme levels and in combination with certain individual characteristics or within particular contexts. The purpose of this review is to describe an empirically grounded theoretical rationale for the hypothesis that empathic tendencies can be “risky strengths.” We propose a model in which typical development of affective and cognitive empathy can be influenced by complex interplay among intraindividual and interindividual moderators that increase risk for empathic personal distress and excessive interpersonal guilt. These intermediate states in turn precipitate internalizing problems that map onto empirically derived fear/arousal and anhedonia/misery subfactors of internalizing disorders. The intraindividual moderators include a genetically influenced propensity toward physiological hyperarousal, which is proposed to interact with genetic propensity to empathic sensitivity to contribute to neurobiological processes that underlie personal distress responses to others' pain or unhappiness. This empathic personal distress then increases risk for internalizing problems, particularly fear/arousal symptoms. In a similar fashion, interactions between genetic propensities toward negative thinking processes and empathic sensitivity are hypothesized to contribute to excess interpersonal guilt in response to others' distress. This interpersonal guilt then increases the risk for internalizing problems, especially anhedonia/misery symptoms. Interindividual moderators, such as maladaptive parenting or chronic exposure to parents' negative affect, further interact with these genetic liabilities to amplify risk for personal distress and interpersonal guilt as well as for consequent internalizing problems. Age-related increases in the heritability of depression, anxiety, and empathy-related constructs are consistent with developmental shifts toward greater influence of intraindividual moderators throughout childhood and adolescence, with interindividual moderators exerting their greatest influence during early childhood. Efforts to modulate neurobiological and behavioral expressions of genetic dysregulation liabilities and to promote adaptive empathic skills must thus begin early in development.

Psychotomimetic effects at initiation of cannabis use are associated with cannabinoid receptor 1 (<i>CNRl</i>) variants in healthy students.,"Krebs, M. O.; Morvan, Y.; Jay, T.; Gaillard, R.; Kebir, O.","We investigated the association of polymorphisms of interest in CNR1, AKT1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes with psychotomimetic effects when first using cannabis (PEFU) and found a significant association with a functional haplotype block in cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1). The literature has shown that cannabinoid receptors are involved in neurodevelopment, brain maturation, and could also be involved in psychosis and addiction. By studying the psychotomimetic effects at initiation of cannabis use in healthy young students with no psychosis or addiction, our study focused on the influence of CNRI gene variants in the expression of psychosis through the role of CNRI in the brain maturation occurring during adolescence. In these young students, the association of CNRI variants with psychotomimetic effects induced by cannabis at first use could accurately reflect the genetic risk of psychosis when exposed to cannabis, by avoiding the confounding factors of preexisting psychosis or the association of these genetic variants to psychosis or addiction. Our results should be replicated in representative samples of the general population. In addition, the predictive value of this genetic marker for developing psychotic disorders when exposed to cannabis has to be determined in prospective studies in the general population as well as in individuals who are at risk for psychosis.

Re: Caution urged in interpreting a negative study of cannabis use and schizophrenia: A response to Dr. Christine Miller.,"DeLisi, Lynn E.","Reply by the current author to the comments made by Christine Miller (see record [rid]2014-11039-012[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2013-42680-001[/rid]). The study was a family study of people who did and did not abuse cannabis as adolescents. There were 4 groups: non-psychotic individuals who did and did not abuse cannabis and people with schizophrenia who did and did not abuse cannabis prior to their illness. What the main study analysis showed was that those individuals who developed schizophrenia after cannabis use in adolescence had a significantly greater family history of schizophrenia than those who used cannabis and did not develop schizophrenia and an elevated family history no different than those with schizophrenia who never used cannabis. The issue is not so much that the sample size was underpowered to detect differences related to cannabis use, but rather that longitudinal studies are the necessary way forward to understand the interaction of cannabis with genetic risk factors to lead to schizophrenia.

Stability and Change in Etiological Factors for Alcohol Use Disorder and Major Depression,"Torvik, FA; Rosenström, TH; Ystrom, E; Tambs, K; Roysamb, E; Czajkowski, N; Gillespie, N; Knudsen, GP; Kendler, KS; Reichborn-Kjennerud, T","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are often comorbid. It is not understood how genetic risk factors for these disorders relate to each other over time and to what degree they are stable. Age-dependent characteristics of the disorders indicate that different genetic factors could be relevant at different stages of life, and MDD may become increasingly correlated with AUD over time. DSM-IV diagnoses of AUD and MDD were assessed by interviews of 2,801 young adult twins between 1999 and 2004 (T1) and 2,284 of the same twins between 2010 and 2011 (T2). Stability, change, and covariation were investigated in longitudinal biometric models. New genetic factors explained 56.4% of the genetic variance in AUD at T2. For MDD, there was full overlap between genetic influences at T1 and T2. Genetic risk factors for MDD were related to AUD, but their association with AUD did not increase over time. Thus, genetic risk factors for AUD, but not MDD, vary with age, suggesting that AUD has age-dependent heritable etiologies. Molecular genetic studies of AUD may therefore benefit from stratifying by age. The new genetic factors in AUD were not related to MDD. Environmental influences on the 2 disorders were correlated in middle, but not in young adulthood. The environmental components for AUD correlated over time (r = .27), but not for MDD. Environmental influences on AUD can have long-lasting effects, and the effects of preventive efforts may be enduring. Environment influences seem to be largely transient.General Scientific SummaryAlcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are influenced by genetic risk factors, and these may vary between life phases. This study suggests that the genetic risk factors for MDD are stable from young to middle adulthood, but vary across time for AUD. Environmental triggers of MDD were transient, but environmental triggers of AUD had lasting effects, suggesting that preventing AUD in young adulthood may be particularly important. The environmental aspects of AUD and MDD became more strongly associated with higher age, suggesting that some environments can lead to both disorders or that the disorders develop together.",2017,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,126,6,812-822,WOS:000406927300009,10.1037/abn0000280,,#3507,Torvik 2017,"",""

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered shared genetic contributions to insomnia and BD as well as SUDs and BD. Electronic health record (EHR) derived phenotypes (phecodes) and questionnaire data were used to examine the relationship between insomnia genetic liability and SUDs in BD. Methods40,839 participants from the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank (BD Biobank; n = 774) and Mayo Clinic Biobank (n = 485 BD cases, n = 39,580 controls) were included in the analyses of diagnosis (phecode) outcomes (insomnia, SUD, alcohol use disorder [AUD] and tobacco use disorder [TUD]). Analyses of specific SUD outcomes obtained through the BD Biobank questionnaire included 1789 cases and considered BD subtype.

Genetic support of a causal relationship between cannabis use and educational attainment: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study of European ancestry,"Chen, DZ; Wang, XP; Huang, T; Jia, JZ","Background and AimsExcessive cannabis use may lead to lower educational attainment. However, this association may be due to confounders and reverse causality. We tested the potential causal relationship between cannabis use disorder (CUD) or life-time cannabis use (LCU) and educational attainment. DesignBidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of sensitivity analyses. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to estimate any direct effect independent of intelligence, smoking initiation or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Setting and participantsEuropean ancestry individuals. The sample sizes of the genome-wide association study ranged from 55 374 to 632 802 participants. MeasurementsGenetic variants of CUD, LCU or educational attainment. FindingsUsing univariable MR, we found evidence of a potential causal effect of genetic liability to CUD on a lower educational attainment [MR, 95% confidence interval (CI)(inverse variance weighted (IVW)) = -1.2 month (-1.9 month, -0.5 month); P = 0.0008]. However, we found no evidence of an effect of genetic liability to LCU on educational attainment [MR, 95% CIIVW = 0.5 month (-1.5 month, 2.6 month), P = 0.6032]. Reverse direction analysis suggested that genetic liability to higher educational attainment had a potential causal effect on lower risk of CUD [odds ratio (OR), 95% CIIVW = 0.39 (0.29, 0.52), P = 1.69 x 10(-10)]. We also found evidence of potential causal effect from genetic liability to higher educational attainment to higher risk of LCU [OR, 95% CIIVW = 1.35 (1.11, 1.66), P = 0.0033]. ConclusionsGenetic liability to cannabis use disorder may lead to lower educational attainment. Genetic liability to higher educational attainment may also lead to higher life-time cannabis use risk and lower cannabis use disorder risk.

However, very little research to date has examined whether the relationship between low birth weight, poor academic performance, and delinquent peer affiliation is moderated by genetic risk. Using data from the National Longitudinal study of Adolescent Health, the present study examines whether male adolescents born at very low birth weights are significantly predisposed to poor academic performance and delinquent peer affiliation. Moreover, we test whether the effect of birth weight on these outcomes is conditioned by level of genetic risk. We find no evidence that very low birth weight males are more likely to affiliate with delinquent peers or perform poorly in school during adolescence. However, upon examining gene-environment interactions, we find that being born at a very low birth weight does significantly increase the odds of poor academic performance and delinquent peer affiliation among males who possess a higher level of genetic risk.

Dysfunctional neural mechanisms for the cognitive control of emotion are implicated in the genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder, with aberrant activity in frontocortical, striatal, and limbic brain regions previously reported in subjects with established bipolar disorder during inhibitory and emotion processing tasks.Methods: Functional brain activity during inhibition of emotional material in young people at increased genetic risk for bipolar disorder was investigated using a facial-emotion go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data from 47 genetically high-risk individuals aged 18 to 30 years with at least one first-degree relative with bipolar disorder were compared with 49 control subjects (within the same age range but without a family history of bipolar disorder or other severe mental illness).Results: Whole-brain corrected analyses revealed a highly specific and significant lack of recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus when inhibiting responses to fearful faces in the high-risk participants compared with control subjects (p = .011, family-wise error, peak voxel).Conclusions: Impaired inhibitory function of the inferior frontal cortex may represent a trait marker of vulnerability to bipolar disorder.

Studies were identified by searching Embase-Ovid, PsycINFO (EBSCO), Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science databases, and yielded an initial total of 9016 papers, leaving finally 23 after the screening process.

Bullying by peers (OR = 2.28 [1.64, 4.34]), maltreatment by an adult (OR = 2.20 [1.72, 2.81]) and parental death (OR = 1.24 [1.06, 1.44]) all increased the risk of psychosis. Moderator analysis showed that negative effects of bullying were detected especially in those with genetic liability for psychosis and exposure to multiple trauma types; studies with higher prevalence of males showed a stronger risk for those exposed to parental death. No significant meta-regression was found between the risk of developing a full clinical psychosis or a psychotic experience. Lack of studies hampered the results about the age of trauma occurrence.

PPP1R12B, encoding another protein in the DARPP-32 family, hasn't been studied in the brain.Methods: Brain-regional gene activity was assessed in three different animal models of SUDs for mRNA level alterations. Genetic associations were assessed by meta-analysis of pre-existing dbGaP GWAS datasets for main effects and epistasis with known genetic risks, followed by cell type-specific pathway delineation. Parkinson's disease (PD) was included as a dopamine-related disease control for SUDs.Findings: In animal models of SUDs, environmentally-altered PPP1R12B expression sex-dependently involves motivation-related brain regions. In humans with polysubstance abuse, meta-analysis of pre-existing datasets revealed that PPP1R12B and PPP1R1B, although expressed in dopamine vs. dopamine-recipient neurons, exerted similar interactions with known genetic risks such as ACTR1B and DRD2 in men but with ADH1B, HGFAC and DRD3 in women. These interactions reached genome-wide significances (P-meta<10(-20)) for SUDs but not for PD (disease selectivity: P = 4.8 x 10(-142), OR = 6.7 for PPP1R12B; P = 8.0 x 10(-8), OR = 2.1 for PPP1R1B).

In particular, it is not clear to what extent the cascading effects of key etiological factors that contribute to an especially severe course of AUD in men also underlie the development of AUD in women. To fill this gap, we examined the adolescent risk factors and adult consequences associated with an adolescent onset and persistent course of AUD in a community sample of women (n = 636) from ages 17 to 29. Women with AUD exhibited greater psychopathology and psychosocial impairment than those without, with an adolescent onset and persistent course indicative of the greatest severity. Notably, high levels of impairment across all women with AUD reduced the utility of onset and course to differentiate profiles of risk and impairment.

Genetic and environmental risk factors in males for self-report externalizing traits in mid-adolescence and criminal behavior through young adulthood,"Kendler, KS; Patrick, CJ; Larsson, H; Gardner, CO; Lichtenstein, P","Background. Externalizing traits or behaviors are typically assessed by self-report scales or criminal records. Few genetically informative studies have used both methods to determine whether they assess the same genetic or environmental risk factors.Method.

Multivariate structural equation modeling was conducted with Mx.Results. The best-fit model contained one genetic, one shared environmental and two non-shared environmental common factors, and variable specific genetic and non-shared environmental factors. The risk for CB was influenced substantially by both genetic (a(2)=0.48) and familial-environmental factors (c(2)=0.22). About one-third of the genetic risk for CB but all of the shared environmental risk was indexed by the self-report measures. The degree to which the individual measures reflected genetic versus familial-environmental risks for CB varied widely. GRD and CLS were correlated with CB mainly through common genetic risk factors. SRD and CB covaried largely because of shared familial-environmental factors. For EXT and IMP, observed correlations with CB resulted in about equal parts from shared genetic and shared familial-environmental factors.Conclusions.

The genetic epidemiology of schizotypal personality disorder,"Kendler, KS; Ohlsson, H; Sundquist, J; Sundquist, K","Background The concept of schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) emerged from observations of personality characteristics common in relatives of schizophrenic patients. While often studied in family designs, few studies and none with genetic measures, have examined SPD in epidemiological samples.Methods We studied individuals born in Sweden 1940-2000 with an ICD-10 diagnosis of SPD with no prior schizophrenia (SZ) diagnosis (n = 2292). Demographic features, patterns of comorbidity, and Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS) were assessed from multiple Swedish registries. Prediction of progression to SZ was assessed by Cox models.Results SPD was rare, with a prevalence of 0.044%, and had high levels of comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OCD, ADHD, and major depression (MD), and increased rates of being single, unemployed and in receipt of welfare. Affected individuals had elevated levels of FGRS for SZ (+0.42), ASD (+0.30), MD (+0.29), and ADHD (+0.20). Compared to cases of schizophrenia, they had significantly lower rates of FGRSSZ, but significantly elevated rates of genetic risk for ASD, MD, and ADHD.

Existing findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that alcohol consumption has a complex polygenic etiology. Currently, there is a lack of studies examining genetic risk for alcohol consumption using polygenic risk scores (PRS) in college samples. In this study, we examined whether alcohol-specific and risky behavior-related PRS were longitudinally associated with alcohol consumption among college students and whether this effect might be partially mediated by impulsivity domains. Methods The sample included n = 2,385 European ancestry (EA) and n = 1,153 African ancestry (AA) college students assessed over the course of 4 years. To indicate genetic risk, 2 PRS were created based on recent large-scale GWAS: alcohol consumption (Liu et al., 2019) -drinks per week (DPW)-PRS and risky behaviors (Linner et al., 2019) -RISK-PRS. The main outcome was alcohol consumption, measured across 4 waves of follow-up data. The UPPS-P impulsivity subscales were examined as mediators of the genetic effect on alcohol consumption. Results The results from structural equation modeling showed that among EA students, both DPW-PRS and RISK-PRS had significant positive effects on alcohol consumption above and beyond UPPS dimensions and control variables. RISK-PRS explained larger portion of variance in alcohol consumption than DPW-PRS. RISK-PRS showed a significant indirect effect on alcohol consumption through sensation seeking and lack of perseverance; no significant indirect effect of DPW-PRS was found. No significant association of either PRS or alcohol consumption was found for AA participants.

Orbitofrontal cortex thickness and substance use disorders in emerging adulthood: causal inferences from a co-twin control/discordant twin study,"Harper, J; Wilson, S; Malone, SM; Hunt, RH; Thomas, KM; Iacono, WG","Background/aims Research linking orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) structure and substance use disorders (SUDs) is largely correlational and often implies a causal effect of addiction/substance exposure on the brain, but familial risk factors (e.g. genetic liability) may confound these associations. We tested whether associations between alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use disorders and OFC thickness reflected the potential causal effects of familial risk or SUDs-related consequences (e.g. substance exposure).Design A co-twin control/discordant twin design separated familial risk confounding from SUD-related consequences.Setting/participants A population-based sample of 436 24-year-old twins (62% monozygotic) from the Minnesota Twin Family Study, USA.Measurements Alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module. Cortical thickness of the medial and lateral OFC (mOFC and lOFC, respectively) was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Findings Lower mOFC (P-values <= 0.006) but not lOFC (P-values >= 0.190) thickness was observed in diagnosed individuals (n = 185) relative to non-SUD controls (n = 251). Co-twin control analyses offered evidence that mOFC associations were consistent with familial risk across SUDs (between-pair effect: P-values <= 0.047) and the independent consequences of having an alcohol or cannabis use disorder (within-pair effect: P-values <= 0.024). That is, within alcohol/cannabis discordant twin pairs, affected twins had significantly lower mOFC thickness compared with their unaffected co-twins.Conclusions A confounder-adjusted analysis of the Minnesota Twin Family Study appeared to indicate that, beyond a substance use disorders general familial risk effect, the experience of an alcohol or cannabis use disorder in emerging adulthood reduces the thickness of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region associated with value-guided decision-making.",2021,,ADDICTION,116,9,2548-2558,WOS:000623678700001,10.1111/add.15447,,#3597,Harper 2021,"",""
Assessing a multivariate model of brain-mediated genetic influences on disordered eating in the ABCD cohort,"Westwater, ML; Mallard, TT; Warrier, V; Bethlehem, RAI; Scheinost, D; Grillon, C; Fletcher, PC; Seidlitz, J; Ernst, M","Eating disorders often emerge during adolescence, and affected individuals frequently demonstrate high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly with depressive and anxiety disorders. Although risk for eating disorders reflects both genetic and neurobiological factors, knowledge of how genetic risk for eating disorders relates to neurobiology and psychiatric symptoms during critical developmental periods remains limited. Here we simultaneously estimated associations between genetic risk, brain structure, and eating-disorder-related psychopathology symptoms in over 4,900 adolescents of European ancestry from the ABCD study (mean age (s.d.) = 9.94 (0.62) years). Polygenic scores for anorexia nervosa (AN PGS) and body mass index (BMI PGS) were related to three morphometric brain features-cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical gray matter volume-and to latent psychopathology factors using structural equation modeling. We identified a three-factor structure of eating-disorder-related psychopathology symptoms: eating, distress, and fear factors. Increased BMI PGS were uniquely associated with greater eating factor scores. Moreover, greater BMI PGS predicted widespread increases in cortical thickness and reductions in surface area while AN PGS were related to reduced caudate volume. Altered default mode and visual network thickness was associated with greater eating factor scores, whereas distress and fear factor scores reflected a shared reduction in somatomotor network thickness. Our novel findings indicate that greater genetic risk for high BMI and altered cortical thickness of canonical brain networks underpin eating disorder symptomatology in early adolescence. As neurobiological factors appear to shape disordered eating earlier in development than previously thought, these results underscore the need for early detection and intervention efforts for eating disorders.",2023,,NATURE MENTAL HEALTH,1,8,,WOS:001390101500007,10.1038/s44220-023-00101-4,,#3599,Westwater 2023,"",""

Methods: This study performed linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and pleiotropic analysis under composite null hypothesis (PLACO) to explore genetic associations, and bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causality between ADHD and thirteen ocular disorders. Results: LDSC showed ADHD genetically correlated with corneal ulcer, keratitis, blepharochalasis, lacrimal system disorders, senile cataract, retinal vascular occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration. MR revealed genetic liability to ADHD increased the risk of corneal ulcer (OR = 1.18, FDR adjusted P = 0.01), keratitis (OR = 1.13, P = 0.007), blepharochalasis (OR = 1.23, P = 0.002), and lacrimal system disorders (OR = 1.09, P = 0.04), while decreasing the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma (OR = 0.83, P = 0.003), exfoliation glaucoma (OR = 0.71, P = 0.001), and normotensive glaucoma (OR = 0.79, P = 0.02).

Cognition is a promising construct for study; yet, evidence that the same cognitive functions are impaired across different forms of psychopathology comes primarily from separate studies of individual categorical diagnoses versus controls. Given growing support for dimensional models that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries, we aimed to determine, within a single cohort, whether performance on measures of executive functions (EFs) predicted dimensions of different psychopathological conditions known to share genetic liability.MethodsData are from 393 participants, ages 8-17, consecutively enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of Genetic Influences on Cognition (LOGIC). This project is conducting deep phenotyping and genomic analyses in youth referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation. Using structural equation modeling, we examined whether EFs predicted variation in core dimensions of the autism spectrum disorder, bipolar illness, and schizophrenia (including social responsiveness, mania/emotion regulation, and positive symptoms of psychosis, respectively).ResultsWe modeled three cognitive factors (working memory, shifting, and executive processing speed) that loaded on a second-order EF factor. The EF factor predicted variation in our three target traits, but not in a negative control (somatization). Moreover, this EF factor was primarily associated with the overlapping (rather than unique) variance across the three outcome measures, suggesting that it related to a general increase in psychopathology symptoms across those dimensions.ConclusionsFindings extend support for the relevance of cognition to neuropsychiatric conditions that share underlying genetic risk. They suggest that higher-order cognition, including EFs, relates to the dimensional spectrum of each of these disorders and not just the clinical diagnoses.

In the ASPIS, higher PRS SZ significantly associated with lower levels of positive (i.e, perceptual distortions), disorganization and paranoid facets of schizotypy, whereas no association with negative (i.e, interpersonal) facets was noted. Importantly, longitudinal data analysis in the ASPIS subsample revealed that PRS SZ was inversely associated with positive schizotypy at military induction (stressed condition) but not at follow-up (nonstressed condition), providing evidence for environmental rather than SZ-implicated genetic influences. Moreover, consistent with prior reports, PRS SZ was positively correlated with trait anxiety in the LOGOS and additionally the recruits with higher PRS SZ and trait anxiety exhibited attenuated paranoid ideation.

Girls are affected significantly more often in adolescence. The diagnostics are multimodal and require extensive knowledge and experience. The symptoms are developmental, younger children often show irritability, reluctance to play and learning problems. Screening instruments are available to identify a risk for the disease at an early stage. Common comorbid disorders are anxiety disorders and anorexia nervosa. The causes are multifactorial. The interaction between genetic risk factors and stressful environmental factors increases the risk of the disease. Psychosocial risk factors are school stress, mobbing, persistent stress and a strained parent-child interaction. Neuropsychological and neurobiological correlates are found in the form of dysfunctions in the limbic system, emotion regulation and stress processing.

In this study, we used genomic structural equation modelling to explore the shared genetic architecture among six externalizing phenotypes and four SUDs used in two previous multivariate genome-wide association studies of an externalizing and an addiction risk factor, respectively. We first evaluated five confirmatory factor analytic models, including a common factor model, alternative parameterizations of two-factor structures and a bifactor model. We next explored the genetic correlations between factors identified in these models and other relevant psychological traits. Finally, we quantified the degree of polygenic overlap between externalizing and addiction risk using MiXeR. We found that the common and two-factor structures provided the best fit to the data, evidenced by high factor loadings, good factor reliability and no evidence of concerning model characteristics. The two-factor models yielded high genetic correlations between factors (r(g)s & GE; 0.87), and between the effect sizes of genetic correlations with external traits (r(g) & GE; 0.95).

Interaction effects of cumulative genetic score and psychological distress on excessive gaming: A 2-year longitudinal study,"Lee, D; Lee, S; Kim, J","Biological and psychological factors influence the multifaceted addictive behavior of excessive gaming. While studies have reported the association of individual monoamine genes and depression or anxiety with excessive gaming, no study has explored the interplay between the biological and psychological factors underlying excessive gaming. Thus, this study examines whether the effects of depression or anxiety on excessive gaming differ as a function of cumulative genetic score (CGS) of seven monoamine genes. We conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over a year with 117 college students (63.2% male; mean age = 21.87). The cross-sectional analyses showed significant interactions between CGS and depression/anxiety on concurrent excessive gaming at an initial and later time point (i.e., Time 1 and Time 2).

We aimed to elucidate the associations between polygenic scores for educational attainment and clinical criterion counts for three SUDs (alcohol, nicotine and cannabis). Design Polygenic association and sibling comparison methods. The latter strengthens inferences in observational research by controlling for confounding factors that differ between families. Setting Six sites in the United States. Participants European ancestry participants aged 25 years and older from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). Polygenic association analyses included 5582 (54% female) participants. Sibling comparisons included 3098 (52% female) participants from 1226 sibling groups nested within the overall sample. Measurements Outcomes included criterion counts for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUDSX), Fagerstrom nicotine dependence (NDSX) and DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (CUDSX). We derived polygenic scores for educational attainment (EduYears-GPS) using summary statistics from a large (> 1 million) genome-wide association study of educational attainment. Findings In polygenic association analyses, higher EduYears-GPS predicted lower AUDSX, NDSX and CUDSX [P < 0.01, effect sizes (R-2) ranging from 0.30 to 1.84%]. These effects were robust in sibling comparisons, where sibling differences in EduYears-GPS predicted all three SUDs (P < 0.05, R-2 0.13-0.20%). Conclusions Individuals who carry more alleles associated with educational attainment tend to meet fewer clinical criteria for alcohol, nicotine and cannabis use disorders, and these effects are robust to rigorous controls for potentially confounding factors that differ between families (e.g. socio-economic status, urban-rural residency and parental education).",2020,,ADDICTION,115,2,337-346,WOS:000492870800001,10.1111/add.14815,,#3656,Salvatore 2020,"",""
High prevalence of alcohol use disorders in 454 young adult offspring from the San Diego prospective study,"Schuckit, MA; Smith, TL; Mendoza, LA; Danko, G; Fisher, H; Laurance, C","BackgroundPreliminary evaluations of 212 drinking offspring from the San Diego Prospective Study (SDPD) indicated that over 50% developed alcohol use disorder (AUD) by their mid-20s. The present analysis evaluated if those findings remained robust when the group increased to 454 individuals, a sample size that facilitated a search for potential contributors to the high AUD prevalence.MethodsSemistructured interviews were used to evaluate lifetime AUD diagnoses in 224 daughters and 230 sons from the SDPS (N = 454) by mean age 26. Analyses compared participants with and without AUD regarding demography, alcohol use, personality, and psychiatric diagnoses. Characteristics associated with AUD were entered together in a backward elimination regression analysis, and the results were entered in a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate potential mediation of risks for alcohol problems.ResultsLifetime AUD was documented for 61% of the sons and 41% of the daughters. Offspring with AUD reported averages of 13 maximum and five usual drinks per occasion and endorsed an average of 4 DSM AUD criteria. Even after considering personality characteristics, family AUD histories, and personal psychiatric histories, significant contributions to the regression analysis were limited to lower levels of response to alcohol, higher positive alcohol expectancies, and drinking to cope. Key elements of the hypothesized SEM were supported, and mediation between the low alcohol response and the number of alcohol problems was documented for expectancies, drinking to cope, and peer heavier drinking.ConclusionThe results support prior high AUD rates in SDPS offspring and demonstrate that the AUD diagnoses were associated with robust alcohol intake and problems.

Early Life Experiences Moderate the Relationship Between Genetic Risk of Autism and Current and Lifetime Mental Health,"Shin, SH; Wright, C; Johnston, S","Although individuals with autism are at greater risk of mental health challenges than others, we know little about the relationship between the mental health of older adults (50+) and autism because they are less likely to be diagnosed. Identifying the risk and protective factors that are associated with mental health can increase educational awareness, inform clinical practice, and provide information to help diagnose and treat older adults with autism. This study used longitudinal panel data of the 2008-2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. It estimated individual random-effect models by interacting a genetic propensity toward autism and early life experiences to test whether the latter has a moderating effect on the relationships between genetics and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score, self-reported depression, and history of psychiatric problems. Results suggest that individuals with a higher genetic propensity for autism are less likely to develop psychiatric problems if they report a positive maternal relationship early in life. Further, a combined effect of police encounters early in life and genetic risk for autism is associated with higher CES-D scores, increased odds of self-reported depression, and a history of psychiatric problems. Clinical applications of these findings include the need to establish and support high-quality relationships by addressing both child and caregiver needs.

Exposure to Circadian Disruption During Adolescence Interacts With a Genetic Risk Factor to Modify Schizophrenia-relevant Behaviors in a Sex-dependent Manner,"Cloutier, ME; Srivastava, LK; Cermakian, N","DTNBP1 is a gene associated with schizophrenia. Postmortem studies found a reduced expression of DTNBP1 in regions associated with schizophrenia in patients' brains. Sandy (Sdy) mice have a loss-of-function mutation in Dtnbp1 gene, resulting in behavioral deficits and brain changes similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. We previously showed that exposing adult Sdy mice to circadian disruption led to an exacerbation of schizophrenia-relevant behaviors. Here we asked whether the interaction between this genetic risk factor and circadian disruption occurs during adolescence, a period when environmental insults can promote schizophrenia symptoms, and whether sex affects this interaction. Starting at postnatal day 21, wild-type (WT) and Sdy males and females were housed for 4 weeks either in a 12 h light:12 h dark (LD 12:12) cycle or under chronic jetlag (CJL). Then, after 2 weeks in LD 12:12, behavioral assessments were conducted, including elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR), social interaction, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. NOR and social novelty tests showed that, surprisingly, CJL during adolescence had opposite effects on WT and Sdy males, that is, behavioral deficits in WT males while rescuing preexisting deficits in Sdy mice. CJL led to decreased sociability in WT and Sdy mice while decreasing PPI only in females. Sdy mice showed decreased anxiety-like behavior compared with wild-type (WT), which was further accentuated by CJL in males. Thus, circadian disruption during adolescence, on its own or in association with Dtnbp1 mutation, can influence cognition, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner.",2022,,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS,37,6,655-672,WOS:000893955400006,10.1177/07487304221125363,,#3675,Cloutier 2022,"",""

The study included detailed questionnaires and genetic sampling, conducted over a period of one and a half years. We hypothesize that parent-child relationship quality and serotonergic multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) interact to influence adolescent NSSI trajectories, with possible gender differences. Using latent growth curve modeling (LGCM), the results revealed a linear decrease in NSSI over time, with parent-child relationship quality significantly predicting initial NSSI levels. The interaction between serotonergic MGPS and parent-child relationship quality predicted the intercept but not the growth rate of NSSI. There were also gender differences, such that female adolescents were more vulnerable to the combined effects of parent-child relationship quality and genetic factors, patterns that emerged for both initial NSSI intercept and slope. These results highlight the pivotal role of genetic and environmental factors, particularly parent-child relationship quality, in adolescent mental health.

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive subtypes of lifetime comorbidity in offspring. Familial risk and environmental variables associated with each subtype (i.e., parenting, childhood physical or sexual abuse, perceived sibling and peer substance use) were identified using multinomial logistic regression.Results: Four classes identified by LCA were characterized as (1) unaffected, (2) alcohol abuse/dependence, (3) alcohol abuse/dependence comorbid with anxiety and depression, and (4) alcohol, cannabis abuse/dependence and nicotine dependence comorbid with conduct disorder. Inconsistent parenting, childhood physical/sexual abuse, and perceived sibling and peer substance use were significantly associated with profiles of offspring comorbidity after adjusting for familial vulnerability. Some associations were specific (i.e., perceived peer alcohol use to the AUD class), while others were general (peer smoking to all 3 comorbidity classes).Conclusions: We observed distinct subtypes of psychiatric and SOD comorbidity in adolescents and young adults.

While substance use can result in specific sleep deficits, genetic pleiotropy could explain part of the relationship between sleep and substance use and use disorders. Here we use the largest publicly available genome-wide summary statistics of substance use behaviours (N = 79,729-632,802) and sleep/activity phenotypes to date (N = 85,502-449,734) to (1) assess the genetic overlap between substance use behaviours and both sleep and circadian-related activity measures, (2) estimate clusters from genetic correlations and (3) test processes of causality versus genetic pleiotropy. We found 31 genetic correlations between substance use and sleep/activity after Bonferroni correction. These patterns of overlap were represented by two genetic clusters: (1) tobacco use severity (age of first regular tobacco use and smoking cessation) and sleep health (sleep duration, sleep efficiency and chronotype) and (2) substance consumption/problematic use (drinks per day and cigarettes per day, cannabis use disorder, opioid use disorder and problematic alcohol use) and sleep problems (insomnia, self-reported short sleep duration, increased number of sleep episodes, increased sleep duration variability and diurnal inactivity) and measures of circadian-related activity (L5, M10 and sleep midpoint). Latent causal variable analyses determined that horizontal pleiotropy (rather than genetic causality) underlies a majority of the associations between substance use and sleep/circadian related measures, except one plausible genetically causal relationship for opioid use disorder on self-reported long sleep duration.

In a previous investigation of a large population cohort, impaired emotional/social cognitive' processing, assessed by questionnaire, was observed to mediate the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression in individuals with ADHD. We set out to replicate and extend this finding in a clinical sample, using task-based and physiological assessments of emotional and cognitive processing. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that directly assessed emotional processing mediates the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression in young people with ADHD.MethodsMales aged 10-17years with ADHD were recruited from UK community clinics (n=194). Research diagnostic interviews (parent and child) were used to assess psychopathology and generate DSM-IV Conduct Disorder symptom scores. Participants completed tasks assessing executive function (response inhibition and set shifting), empathy for fear, sadness and happiness, and fear conditioning [measured using skin conductance responses (SCR) to aversive stimuli].ResultsCOMT Val allele carriers showed poorer response inhibition (F=5.27, p=.02) and set shifting abilities (F=6.45, p=.01), reduced fear empathy (F=4.33, p=.04) and reduced autonomic responsiveness (lower SCRs) to the conditioned aversive stimulus (F=11.74, p=.001). COMT Val158Met did not predict impairments in recognising others' emotions or affective empathy for happiness or sadness. Mediation analysis revealed that impaired fear-related mechanisms indirectly mediated the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression.ConclusionOur findings suggest fear mechanisms as possible targets for psychological interventions to disrupt links between genetic risk and aggressive outcomes in ADHD.

Catalytic Reaction Model of Suicide,"McPherson, P; Sall, S; Santos, A; Thompson, W; Dwyer, DS","Suicide is a devastating outcome of unresolved issues that affect mental health, general wellbeing and socioeconomic stress. The biology of suicidal behavior is still poorly understood, although progress has been made. Suicidal behavior runs in families and genetic studies have provided initial glimpses into potential genes that contribute to suicide risk. Here, we attempt to unify the biology and behavioral dimensions into a model that can guide research in this area. The proposed model envisions suicidal behavior as a catalytic reaction that may result in suicide depending on the conditions, analogously to enzyme catalysis of chemical reactions. A wide array of substrates or reactants, such as hopelessness, depression, debilitating illnesses and diminished motivation can mobilize suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), which can then catalyze the final step/act of suicide. Here, we focus on three biological substrates in particular: threat assessment, motivation to engage in life and impulsivity. Genetic risk factors can affect each of these processes and tilt the balance toward suicidal behavior when existential crises (real or perceived) emerge such as loss of a loved one, sudden changes in social status or serious health issues. Although suicide is a uniquely human behavior, many of the fundamental biological processes are evolutionarily conserved. Insights from animal models may help to shape our understanding of suicidal behavior in man. By examining counterparts of the major biological processes in other organisms, new ideas about the role of genetic risk factors may emerge along with possible therapeutic interventions or preventive measures.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,13,,,WOS:000778607600001,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.817224,,#3702,McPherson 2022,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Overall, we compared 1024 psychotic patients, 994 unaffected siblings and 566 controls on the prevalence of 125 lifetime diseases, and 19 self-reported somatic complaints. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of two or more complaints/diseases in the same individual. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) were used to investigate the effects of gender, age (adolescent, young, older) and familial liability (patients, siblings, controls) and their interactions on multimorbidity.Results: Familial liability had a significant effect on multimorbidity of either complaints or diseases. Patients had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity of complaints compared to siblings (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.79-2.69, P < 0.001) and to controls (3.05, 2.35-3.96, P < 0.001).

How Do We 'Learn' Addiction? Risk Factors and Mechanisms Getting Addicted to Alcohol,"Nägele, C; Friedel, E; Kienast, T; Kiefer, F","Background: Alcohol dependence is one of the leading contributors to the burden of disease in the world. A range of genetic and environmental risk factors has been identified to date, and preclinical and clinical studies including imaging studies have identified neuronal networks involved in the development of alcohol dependence. Methods: We review genetic and environmental risk factors for the development of alcohol addiction as well as structural and neuronal changes, including their transmitter systems, due to regular alcohol intake. Results: Stress as well as family background and, in juveniles, the peer group could be identified as environmental risk factors for alcohol dependence. Heritability is estimated at around 50%, and it seems to be comparable in women and men. There is ongoing research on a broad range of putative endophenotypes such as tolerance of the effects of alcohol intake or personal traits like 'impulsivity'. On the neurobiological level, chronic alcohol intake seems to render mesolimbic circuits hypersensitive to alcohol and alter the motivational reward system including dopaminergic neurotransmission. Conclusion: Environmental and genetic risk factors, and especially their interaction, facilitate the development of alcohol dependence. Ongoing alcohol intake results in profound alterations of neuronal systems crucial for motivation, learning, memory and cognition control. Future studies should further combine the knowledge of neurobiological mechanisms and risk factors to develop new prevention strategies. (C) 2014 S.

The second question we approached by applying the same protocol to 22 healthy first-degree relatives of patients with BD1 and 22 persons without a family history of mental disorders (sample 2).Results: In comparison with their control groups, BD1 patients and healthy first-degree relatives of patients with BD1 showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule and right uncinate fasciculus. White matter integrity in corpus callosum was reduced in BD1 patients only. In addition, reduced FA in anterior limb of the internal capsule correlated significantly with an increased number of errors during set shifting and increased risk taking and reduced FA in uncinate fasciculus correlated significantly with increased risk taking.Conclusions: Similar white matter alterations in BD1 patients and healthy relatives of BD1 patients are associated with comparable behavioral abnormalities. Further, results indicate that altered frontolimbic and frontothalamic connectivity and corresponding behavioral abnormalities might be a trait and vulnerability marker of BD1, whereas interhemispheric connectivity appears to be a disease marker.",2013,,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,74,12,908-916,WOS:000326983900013,10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.010,,#3709,Linke 2013,"",""

We integrated SNP-based, gene-based, and protein-protein interaction network analyses to identify shared risk genes or gene subnetworks for AD+ND in African Americans (AAs, N = 2,094) and European Americans (EAs, N = 1,207). The DSM-IV criterion counts for AD and ND were modeled as two dependent variables in a multivariate linear mixed model, and analyzed separately for the two populations. The most significant SNP was rs6579845 in EAs (p < 1.29 x 10(-8)) in GM2A, which encodes GM2 ganglioside activator, and is a cis-expression quantitative locus that affects GM2A expression in blood and brain tissues. However, this SNP was not replicated in our another small sample (N = 678). We identified a subnetwork of 24 genes that contributed to the AD+ND criterion counts. In the gene-set analysis for the subnetwork in an independent sample, the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment project (predominately EAs), these 24 genes as a set differed in AD+ND versus control subjects in EAs (p = .041). Functional enrichment analysis for this subnetwork revealed that the gene enrichment involved primarily nerve growth factor pathways, and cocaine and amphetamine addiction.

Next, DNA samples from 264 students were collected for low-depth whole-genome sequencing. The sequencing detected HRB risk loci, 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms based to significant SNP. Subsequently, PRSs were assessed and divided into low, moderate, and high genetic risk according to the tertiles and chronotypes and interaction models were constructed to evaluate the association of interaction effect and clustering of adolescent HRBs. The chronotypes and the association between CLOCK-PRS and HRBs were examined to explore the association between chronotypes and mental health and circadian CLOCK-PRS and HRBs.ResultsFour prominent areas were displayed by clustering information fields in network and density visualization modes in VOS-viewer. The total score of evening chronotypes correlated with high-level clustering of HRBs in adolescents, co-occurrence, and mental health, and the difference was statistically significant. After controlling covariates, the results remained consistent. Three-way interactions between chronotype, age, and mental health were observed, and the differences were statistically significant. CLOCK-PRS was constructed to identify genetic susceptibility to the clustering of HRBs. The interaction of evening chronotypes and high genetic risk CLOCK-PRS was positively correlated with high-level clustering of HRBs and HRB co-occurrence in adolescents, and the difference was statistically significant.

We studied ERP stability in 48 pairs of identical twins (age 14-16 years) tested 1 year apart. Trial-averaged voltage waveforms were extracted from electroencephalographic recordings from oddball/novelty, go/no-go, and flanker tasks, and 16 amplitude measures were examined. Members of twin pairs were highly similar, whether based on ERP amplitude measures (intraclass correlation [ICC] median=.64, range=.44-.86) or three factor scores (all ICCs.69) derived from them. Stability was high overall, with 69% of the 16 individual measures generating stability coefficients exceeding .70 and all factor scores showing stability above .75. Measures from 10 difference waveforms calculated from paired conditions within tasks were also examined, and were associated with lower twin similarity (ICC median=.52, .38-.64) and developmental stability (only 30% exceeding .70). In a supplemental analysis, we found significant developmental stability for error-related negativity (range=.45-.55) and positivity (.56-.70) measures when average waveforms were based on one or more trials, and that these values were equivalent to those derived from averages using the current field recommendation, which requires six or more trials. Overall, we conclude that the studied brain measures are largely stable over 1 year of mid- to late adolescence, likely reflecting familial etiologic influences on brain functions pertaining to cognitive control and salience recognition.",2016,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,53,7,991-1007,WOS:000378940000004,10.1111/psyp.12646,,#3717,Burwell 2016,"",""
Father Absence and Accelerated Reproductive Development in Non-Hispanic White Women in the United States,"Gaydosh, L; Belsky, DW; Domingue, BW; Boardman, JD; Harris, KM","Girls who experience father absence in childhood also experience accelerated reproductive development in comparison with peers with present fathers.

We find that young women's accelerated menarche polygenic scores are unrelated to their exposure to father absence.

For both univariable MR (UVMR) and multivariable MR (MVMR), the inverse variance weighting estimates were reported as main results. MR-Egger, weighted median, and generalized summary-data-based MR (GSMR) methods for UVMR, and MVMR-Egger and MVMR-robust methods for MVMR were used as sensitivity analyses. Negative control analyses, MVMR of age at first birth (AFB) and age at first sexual intercourse (AFS) on MDD, and sex-combined genetic variants for AFB and AFS were performed to enhance the robustness of our study.Results: There was substantial evidence for associations of genetically predicted later age at menarche (AAM) (odds ratio (OR) = 0.97, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-0.99, P = 0.007), AFB (OR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.86-0.97, P = 0.002) and AFS (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI = 0.60-0.80, P < 0.001) with lower MDD risk in UVMR.

Genetic and Environmental Influences on the Relationship Between Mastery and Alcohol Dependence,"Kiecolt, KJ; Aggen, SH; Kendler, KS","Background Sense of mastery, a personal resource, is likely to have an inverse association with alcohol dependence. Previous evidence, however, is sparse. In addition, the extent to which an association is due to genetic or environmental factors is unknown. Methods Data were from 3,983 male twins and 2,630 female twins who had ever used alcohol, interviewed in the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Mastery was measured by a 6-item scale. Lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence was based on DSM-IV criteria assessed in a structured diagnostic interview. Univariate analyses modeled the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to mastery and alcohol dependence using Mx software. Bivariate Cholesky models were fit to the mastery and alcohol dependence raw data. Results In the best-fitting model of mastery, genetic factors accounted for about 33% of the observed variance. Nonshared environmental factors, including random measurement error, accounted for the remaining 67%. Fifty-six percent of the variance in liability to alcohol dependence was genetic, and the other 44% was explained by the nonshared environment. The phenotypic polychoric correlation between mastery and alcohol dependence of 0.18 was primarily (67% in the best-fitting model) explained by genes common to both low mastery and alcohol dependence; the rest was explained by nonshared environmental factors. Conclusions The findings indicate that genetic risk for alcohol dependence overlaps with genetic factors that influence sense of mastery.

However, it is unclear whether this relationship is causal or explained by confounding bias (e.g., common underlying causes or reverse causality). We investigated the bidirectional causal relationship of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) with ten mental health and substance use disorders, applying two-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR). Genetic instruments for the exposures and outcomes were derived from the largest available, non-overlapping genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Summary-level data for objectively assessed PA (accelerometer-based average activity, moderate activity, and walking) and SB and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA were obtained from the UK Biobank. Data for mental health/substance use disorders were obtained from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use.

However, we found evidence of reverse causality in the relationship between SB and schizophrenia. Further, PTSD, bipolar disorder, anorexia, and ADHD were all associated with increased PA. This study provides evidence consistent with a causal protective effect of objectively assessed but not self-reported PA on reduced depression and cigarette smoking. Objectively assessed SB had a protective relationship with anorexia.

To address this, we investigated whether the genetic architecture of SA and various RBVs (i.e., caudate nucleus, hippocampus, brainstem, ventral diencephalon, thalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and intracranial volume (ICV)) was shared. We leveraged GWAS summary statistics from the largest available datasets on SA (N = 958,896) and intracranial and subcortical RBVs (N = 74,898). Using linkage disequilibrium score regression, we estimated genome-wide genetic correlations between SA and individual RBVs. GWAS-pairwise analyses identified genomic segments associated with both SA and RBVs, followed by functional annotation. Additionally, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGS) for SA were associated with ICV and subcortical brain structure phenotypes in youth of European ancestry (N = 5276) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Linkage disequilibrium score regression results indicated a significant genetic correlation between SA and ICV (rG = -0.10, p-value = 1.9 x 10-3). GWAS-pairwise analyses and functional annotation revealed 10 genomic segments associated with SA and at least one RBV (thalamus, putamen and caudate nucleus). After adjusting for multiple tests, PGS association analysis indicated that a higher PGS for SA was significantly associated with a smaller volume of the right nucleus accumbens (b = -7.05, p = 0.018).

Converging evidence from animal and human studies demonstrates that dopamine transmission, striatal and frontal brain regions, and attention and switching behaviors are essential components of a multilevel circuit involved in salience, and disruptions in that circuit may lead to features of psychosis. Yet, it is possible that unaffected relatives may also possess characteristics that protect against development of illness. We hypothesized that reduced switch cost in a cued task-switching task, may be a behavioral expression of this ''resilience'' phenotype that will be observable in unaffected relatives.Methods: We tested a large community sample (n = 536) via the web, to assess different subcomponents of cognitive control, including task-switching and working memory, as well as risk-taking, among individuals who report having an affected relative with a psychotic or mood disorder.Results: Healthy individuals with suspected genetic risk due to a self-reported familial history of a psychotic disorder demonstrated better task-switching performance compared to healthy people without a psychiatrically ill relative and those with a relative with a mood disorder. This result was specific to illness status and task domain, in that individuals with a personal history of depression or anxiety did not show improved task-switching performance, and this improvement was selective to task-switching and not seen in other putative cognitive control domains (working memory or risk taking).Conclusions: Although this study has limitations and independent replication is needed, these preliminary findings suggest a potential avenue for understanding susceptibility to these disorders by highlighting possible protective as well as vulnerability-related aspects of risk phenotypes.",2018,,BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR,8,6,,WOS:000434409200020,10.1002/brb3.988,,#3776,Sabb 2018,"",""

However, previous studies have either investigated maltreatment associations with single cognitive domains or failed to adequately control for confounders such as depression, socioeconomic environment, and genetic predisposition. We aimed to isolate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and dysfunction in diverse cognitive domains, while estimating the contribution of potential confounders to this relationship, and to investigate gene-environment interactions. We included 547 depressive disorder and 670 healthy control participants (mean age: 34.7 years, SD = 13.2). Cognitive functioning was assessed for the domains of working memory, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, memory, and verbal intelligence using neuropsychological tests. Childhood maltreatment and parental education were assessed using self-reports, and psychiatric diagnosis was based on DSM-IV criteria. Polygenic scores for depression and for educational attainment were calculated. Multivariate analysis of cognitive domains yielded significant associations with childhood maltreatment (eta(2)(p) = 0.083,P < 0.001), depression (eta(2)(p) = 0.097,P < 0.001), parental education (eta(2)(p) = 0.085,P < 0.001), and polygenic scores for depression (eta(2)(p) = 0.021,P = 0.005) and educational attainment (eta(2)(p) = 0.031,P < 0.001). Each of these associations remained significant when including all of the predictors in one model. Univariate tests revealed that maltreatment was associated with poorer performance in all cognitive domains. Thus, environmental, psychopathological, and genetic risk factors each independently affect cognition. The insights of the current study may aid in estimating the potential impact of different loci of interventions for cognitive dysfunction. Future research should investigate if customized interventions, informed by individual risk profiles and related cognitive preconditions, might enhance response to therapeutic treatments.",2021,,NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,46,5,891-899,WOS:000562674000001,10.1038/s41386-020-00794-6,,#3777,Goltermann 2021,"",""
Association between suicidal ideation and tandem repeats in contactins,"Parikh, K; Reis, AQ; Wendt, FR","Background: Death by suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci that associate with suicidal ideation and related behaviours. One such group of loci are the six contactin genes (CNTN1-6) that are critical to neurodevelopment through regulating neurite structure. Because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected by GWAS often map to non-coding intergenic regions, we investigated whether repetitive variants in CNTNs associated with suicidality in a young cohort aged 8 to 21. Understanding the genetic liability of suicidal thought and behavior in this age group will promote early intervention and treatment.Methods: Genotypic and phenotypic data were obtained from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort (PNC). Across six CNTNs, 232 short tandem repeats (STRs) were analyzed in up to 4,595 individuals of European ancestry who expressed current, previous, or no suicidal ideation. STRs were imputed into SNP arrays using a phased SNP-STR haplotype reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project. We tested several additive and interactive models of locus-level burden (i.e., sum of STR alleles) with respect to suicidal ideation. Additive models included sex, birth year, developmental stage (""DevStage""), and the first 10 principal components of ancestry as covariates; interactive models assessed the effect of STR-by-DevStage considering all other covariates.Results: CNTN1-[T](N) interacted with DevStage to increase risk for current suicidal ideation (CNTN1-[T](N)-by-DevStage; p = 0.00035). Compared to the youngest age group, the middle (OR = 1.80, p = 0.0514) and oldest (OR = 3.82, p = 0.0002) participant groups had significantly higher odds of suicidal ideation as their STR length expanded; this result was independent of polygenic scores for suicidal ideation.Discussion: These findings highlight diversity in the genetic effects (i.e., SNP and STR) acting on suicidal thoughts and behavior and advance our understanding of suicidal ideation across childhood and adolescence.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,14,,,WOS:001144407400001,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1236540,,#3783,Parikh 2024,"",""

We report on the performance of multiple classification methods used to predict a clinician-consensus ADHD diagnosis. Methods ranged from fairly simple (e.g., logistic regression) to more complex (e.g., random forest) but emphasized a multistage Bayesian approach. Classifiers were evaluated in two large (N > 1,000) independent cohorts. The multistage Bayesian classifier provided an intuitive approach consistent with clinical workflows and was able to predict expert consensus ADHD diagnosis with high accuracy (> 86%)-though not significantly better than other methods.

How important are parents in the development of child anxiety and depression? A genomic analysis of parent-offspring trios in the Norwegian Mother Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa),"Cheesman, R; Eilertsen, EM; Ahmadzadeh, YI; Gjerde, LC; Hannigan, LJ; Havdahl, A; Young, AI; Eley, TC; Njolstad, PR; Magnus, P; Andreassen, OA; Ystrom, E; McAdams, TA","Background Many studies detect associations between parent behaviour and child symptoms of anxiety and depression. Despite knowledge that anxiety and depression are influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, most studies do not account for shared familial genetic risk. Quantitative genetic designs provide a means of controlling for shared genetics, but rely on observed putative exposure variables, and require data from highly specific family structures. Methods The intergenerational genomic method, Relatedness Disequilibrium Regression (RDR), indexes environmental effects of parents on child traits using measured genotypes. RDR estimates how much the parent genome influences the child indirectly via the environment, over and above effects of genetic factors acting directly in the child. This 'genetic nurture' effect is agnostic to parent phenotype and captures unmeasured heritable parent behaviours. We applied RDR in a sample of 11,598 parent-offspring trios from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) to estimate parental genetic nurture separately from direct child genetic effects on anxiety and depression symptoms at age 8. We tested for mediation of genetic nurture via maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Results were compared to a complementary non-genomic pedigree model. Results Parental genetic nurture explained 14% of the variance in depression symptoms at age 8. Subsequent analyses suggested that maternal anxiety and depression partially mediated this effect. The genetic nurture effect was mirrored by the finding of family environmental influence in our pedigree model. In contrast, variance in anxiety symptoms was not significantly influenced by common genetic variation in children or parents, despite a moderate pedigree heritability. Conclusions Genomic methods like RDR represent new opportunities for genetically sensitive family research on complex human traits, which until now has been largely confined to adoption, twin and other pedigree designs. Our results are relevant to debates about the role of parents in the development of anxiety and depression in children, and possibly where to intervene to reduce problems.",2020,,BMC MEDICINE,18,1,,WOS:000587056200001,10.1186/s12916-020-01760-1,,#3787,Cheesman 2020,"",For Mahnoor's review?
Prospectively assessed early life experiences in relation to cortisol reactivity in adolescents at risk for asthma,"Kelsay, K; Leung, DYM; Mrazek, DA; Klinnert, MD","Altered cortisol reactivity in individuals with asthma likely increases the risk of inflammation in the face of stress. Understanding antecedents of cortisol reactivity enhances knowledge of factors affecting asthma. Forty-eight subjects genetically predisposed for asthma, recruited from a study that assessed them from birth, completed a laboratory stress procedure and self-report measures at ages 1719 years. Observation and parent reports from age 0 to 2 years were used to create a parent child relationship risk variable and to define criteria for a cumulative risk variable. In repeated measures analysis of 46 adolescents, those who had experienced early parent child relationship problems, specifically insecure attachment, had an attenuated cortisol stress response, even after controlling for concurrent psychological function and recent stressors (F?=?4.6, p?<?.005). Cortisol stress response was not related to asthma status. This study supports a relationship between the parent child relationship during the first 2 years of life and later cortisol response to stress in youth at genetic risk for asthma.

Because longitudinal work indicates that cannabis use precedes psychotic symptoms, it seems reasonable to assume a causal relationship. However, more work is needed to address the possibility of gene-environment correlation (for example, genetic risk for psychosis causing onset of cannabis use). Moreover, knowledge about underlying biological mechanisms linking cannabis use and psychosis is still relatively limited. In order to understand how cannabis use may lead to an increased risk for psychosis, in the present article we (a) review the epidemiological, neurobiological, and genetic evidence linking cannabinoids and psychosis, (b) assess the quality of the evidence, and finally (c) try to integrate the most robust findings into a neurodevelopmental model of cannabis-induced psychosis and identify the gaps in knowledge that are in need of further investigation.",2014,,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, VOL 10",10,,767-791,WOS:000336428200029,10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153631,,#3790,vanWinkel 2014,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

However, it is unclear if the disorder is causally associated with these neurocognitive features. Here, we applied a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to summary GWAS data to explore the presence and direction of a causal effect between ADHD and a range of neurocognitive features and other psychiatric disorders. The inverse variance weighted method was used in the main analysis, and two MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median) were used for robustness checks. We found that genetic risk for ADHD was causally associated with a decreased area of lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Conversely, we found that brain volume and some features of intrinsic functional connectivity had causal effects on ADHD risk. Bidirectional causal links were found between ADHD and adult general intelligence, as well as depression and autistic spectrum disorders. Such work highlights the important ties between ADHD and general cognitive ability, and suggest some neural features, previously merely associated with the disorder, may play a causal role in its pathogenesis.",2022,,TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY,12,1,,WOS:000852416800002,10.1038/s41398-022-02139-x,,#3795,Ahn 2022,"",""
Paternal Preconception Every-Other-Day Ethanol Drinking Alters Behavior and Ethanol Consumption in Offspring,"Beeler, E; Nobile, ZL; Homanics, GE","Alcohol use disorder is a devastating disease with a complex etiology.

In the current study, we used a voluntary oral route of paternal preconception EtOH exposure, i.e., intermittent every-other-day two-bottle choice drinking, and tested offspring for behavioral alterations. Fifteen EtOH drinking sires and 10 control sires were mated to EtOH naive females to produce EtOH-sired and control-sired offspring. These offspring were tested using the elevated plus maze, open field, drinking in the dark, and unlimited access two-bottle choice assays. We found that paternal preconception every-other-day two-bottle choice drinking resulted in reduced EtOH consumption selectively in male offspring in the drinking in the dark assay compared to control-sired offspring. No differences were detected in either sex in the unlimited access two-bottle choice and elevated plus maze assays. Open field analysis revealed complex changes in basal behavior and EtOH-induced behaviors that were sex specific. We concluded that paternal preconception voluntary EtOH consumption has persistent effects that impact the next generation.

HPA-axis multilocus genetic interaction with stress life events in predicting changes in adolescent suicidal ideation,"Zhao, X; Wang, DF; Chang, MM; He, Z; Zeng, ZH; Ren, MH; Hu, YQ; Li, ZH","Background: Research suggests that genetic variants linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis moderate the association between stressors and change in suicidal ideation, but examining gene-environment interactions with single polymorphisms limits power. This study investigates how interactions between stressful life events and HPA-axis polygenic risk predict changes in suicidal ideation. Methods: A sample of 760 adolescents (Mage = 14.15 +/- 0.63 years; 54.6 % girls) was followed up over two years. The polygenic risk was assessed using a multilocus genetic profile score (MGPS) based on the additive effects of six HPA-axis candidate genes (SKS2, NR3C1, NR3C2, FKBP5). Participants were categorized into distinct trajectories of suicidal ideation based on time-varying changes in their ideation scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of trajectory membership. Results: (1) Five distinct trajectories of suicidal ideation were identified: resistance (52.7 %), persistence (13.1 %), delayed (11.4 %), remission (15.6 %), and relapsing (7.2 %). (2) The combination of HPA-axis MGPS and SLEs showed good predictive accuracy for suicidal ideation trajectories, as indicated by the area under the ROC curve. (3) The interaction between all six stressful life events and HPA-axis MGPS is more predictive of developing persistent trajectories of suicidal ideation. Meanwhile, HPA-axis MGPS interacted with factors such as interpersonal relationships, academic pressure, and loss to better predict the delayed and relapsing suicidal ideation compared to the resistance group.

Maladaptive Decision Making and Substance Use Outcomes in High-Risk Individuals: Preliminary Evidence for the Role of 5-HTTLPR Variation,"O'Brien, JW; Lichenstein, SD; Hill, SY","Objective: Individuals with multiple alcohol-dependent (AD) relatives are at increased risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Prospective, longitudinal studies of high-risk (HR) individuals afford the opportunity to determine potential risk markers of SUDs. The current study assessed the effect of familial risk and genetic variation on Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) performance and tested for an association between IGT performance and SUD outcomes. Method: Individuals from multiplex AD families (n = 63) and low-risk (LR; n = 45) control families, ages 16-34 years, were tested using a computerized version of the IGT. SUD outcomes were assessed at approximately yearly intervals. 5-HTTLPR and COMT genotypes were available for the majority of participants (n = 86). Results: HR offspring showed poorer performance overall on the IGT and especially poor performance on the final trial block (Block 5), indicating a failure to improve decision making with previous experience. The 5-HTTLPR short-allele homozygote participants performed worse than long-allele carriers, with HR S/S carriers exhibiting particularly poor performance. There was no main effect of COMT on IGT performance and no significant COMT by Risk interaction. Significantly more individuals in the HR than LR group met criteria for SUD. Importantly, disadvantageous performance on IGT Block 5 was significantly associated with an earlier age at SUD onset. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that both familial risk of SUD and 5-HTTLPR variation impact performance on the IGT. Poorer IGT performance was associated with earlier onset of SUD, suggesting that HR individuals who fail to appropriately attend to long-term costs and benefits during a decision-making task are especially at risk for developing SUD in adolescence and young adulthood.",2014,,JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS,75,4,643-652,WOS:000339138500012,10.15288/jsad.2014.75.643,,#3799,O'Brien 2014,"",""
Childhood parenting and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms: Moderation by multilocus hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related genetic variation,"Cao, C; Rijlaarsdam, J","Genetic variants that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function have been demonstrated to moderate the association between parenting and mental health.

Results showed that the MGPS interacted with both maternal and paternal parenting in the association with adolescent internalizing symptoms, but not externalizing symptoms. Consistent with the differential susceptibility model, adolescents with high versus low MGPS exhibited not only more internalizing symptoms when exposed to low quality of parenting but also less internalizing symptoms when exposed to high quality of parenting.

Furthermore, most studies have included relatively few participants (<200), and none has examined the ages of highest risk for each TS-associated comorbidity or their etiologic relationship to TS.OBJECTIVE To characterize the lifetime prevalence, clinical associations, ages of highest risk, and etiology of psychiatric comorbidity among individuals with TS.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional structured diagnostic interviews conducted between April 1, 1992, and December 31, 2008, of participants with TS (n = 1374) and TS-unaffected family members (n = 1142).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime prevalence of comorbid DSM-IV-TR disorders, their heritabilities, ages of maximal risk, and associations with symptom severity, age at onset, and parental psychiatric history.RESULTS The lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric comorbidity among individuals with TS was 85.7%; 57.7% of the population had 2 or more psychiatric disorders. The mean (SD) number of lifetime comorbid diagnoses was 2.1 (1.6); the mean number was 0.9 (1.3) when obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were excluded, and 72.1% of the individuals met the criteria for OCD or ADHD. Other disorders, including mood, anxiety, and disruptive behavior, each occurred in approximately 30% of the participants. The age of greatest risk for the onset of most comorbid psychiatric disorders was between 4 and 10 years, with the exception of eating and substance use disorders, which began in adolescence (interquartile range, 15-19 years for both). Tourette syndrome was associated with increased risk of anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; P = .04) and decreased risk of substance use disorders (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P = .02) independent from comorbid OCD and ADHD; however, high rates of mood disorders among participants with TS (29.8%) may be accounted for by comorbid OCD (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.9-4.8; P < .001). Parental history of ADHD was associated with a higher burden of non-OCD, non-ADHD comorbid psychiatric disorders (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.61; P < .001). Genetic correlations between TS and mood (RhoG, 0.47), anxiety (RhoG, 0.35), and disruptive behavior disorders (RhoG, 0.48), may be accounted for by ADHD and, for mood disorders, by OCD.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive of its kind. It confirms the belief that psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with TS, demonstrates that most comorbidities begin early in life, and indicates that certain comorbidities may be mediated by the presence of comorbid OCD or ADHD. In addition, genetic analyses suggest that some comorbidities may be more biologically related to OCD and/or ADHD rather than to TS.",2015,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,72,4,325-333,WOS:000352487000004,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2650,,#3816,TouretteSyndromeAssocIntConsor 2015,"",""
A choose your own adventure story: Conceptualizing depression in children and adolescents from traditional DSM and alternative latent dimensional approaches,"Hankin, BL","For the past several decades, the phenomenon of depression largely has been defined, classified, and thus assessed and analyzed, according to criteria based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (now DSM5). A substantial body of knowledge on epidemiology, course, risk factors, correlates, consequences, assessment, and intervention for youth depression is based on this classical nosological approach to conceptualizing depression. Yet, recent structural and classification approaches, such as latent dimensional bifactor models (e.g., P factor model; Caspi et al., 2014) and hierarchical organizations (e.g., HiTOP; Kotov, Waszczuk, Krueger, Forbes, & Watson, 2017), have been proposed and supported as alternative options to characterize features of depression. This paper considers conceptualizations of depression among youth with a particular focus on validity: how important clinical outcomes and risks (genetic, neural, temperament, early pubertal timing, stress, and cognitive) relate to depression when ascertained via traditional DSM-defined depression versus more recent latent dimensional model approaches. The construct validity of depression, in terms of associations within respective nomological networks, varies by depression conceptualization. Clinical scientists and applied practitioners need to clearly think through the nature of what depression is and how the latent construct is conceptualized and measured.

Especially the role of copy number variations (CNVs) remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to identify susceptibility variants associated with SA among Chinese with major depressive disorder (MDD), covering both CNVs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on MDD patients with and without SA and top results were tested in a replication study. A genome-wide CNV study was also performed. Subsequently, a validation assay using qRT-PCR technology was performed to confirm any associated CNVs and then applied to the entire cohort to examine the association.Results: Although GWAS did not identify any SNPs reaching genome-wide significance, we identified TPH2 as the top susceptibility gene (p-value = 2.75e - 05) in gene-based analysis, which is a strong biological candidate for its role in the serotonergic system. As for CNV analysis, we found that the global rate of CNV was higher in SA than that in non-SA subjects (p-value = 0.023). Genome-wide CNV study revealed an SA-associated CNV region that achieved genome-wide significance (corrected p-value = 0.014). The associated CNV was successfully validated with a more rigorous qRT-PCR assay and identified to be a common variant in this cohort. Its deletion rate was higher in SA subjects [OR = 2.05 (1.02-4.12), adjusted p-value = 0.045]. Based on the GTEx database, genetic variants that probed this CNV were significantly associated with the expression level of ZNF33B in two brain regions (p-value < 4.2e - 05). In stratified analysis, the CNV showed a significant effect [OR = 2.58 (1.06-6.27), p-value = 0.039] in those with high neuroticism but not in those with average or low neuroticism.Conclusions: We identified a new common CNV likely involved in the etiology of SA.

A case of a four-year-old child adopted at eight months with unusual mood patterns and significant polypharmacy,"Romanowicz, M; McKean, AJ; Voort, JV","Background: Long-term effects of neglect in early life are still widely unknown. Diversity of outcomes can be explained by differences in genetic risk, epigenetics, prenatal factors, exposure to stress and/or substances, and parent-child interactions. Very common sub-threshold presentations of children with history of early trauma are challenging not only to diagnose but also in treatment.Case presentation: A Caucasian 4-year-old, adopted at 8 months, male patient with early history of neglect presented to pediatrician with symptoms of behavioral dyscontrol, emotional dysregulation, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, obsessions with food, and attachment issues. He was subsequently seen by two different child psychiatrists. Pharmacotherapy treatment attempted included guanfacine, fluoxetine and amphetamine salts as well as quetiapine, aripiprazole and thioridazine without much improvement. Risperidone initiated by primary care seemed to help with his symptoms of dyscontrol initially but later the dose had to be escalated to 6 mg total for the same result. After an episode of significant aggression, the patient was admitted to inpatient child psychiatric unit for stabilization and taper of the medicine.Conclusions: The case illustrates difficulties in management of children with early history of neglect.

"""There may be a genetic tendency ..."": How adoptive parents understand and communicate about substance use and risk behaviors with their adolescent children","Goldberg, AE; Siracusa, L; Shuster, S; Brodzinsky, D","For adoptive parents, evaluating their children's potential for risk-taking behaviors, such as substance use, may be complicated by both known and unknown elements of their children's background, which may impact their children's risk profile. Grounded in a framework that integrates concepts of uncertainty management and communicative openness, this study explores how 68 adoptive parents (25 lesbian mothers, 20 gay fathers, and 23 heterosexual parents) understand, and communicate with their early adolescent children about, such risks. Our qualitative analysis revealed that parents' concerns related to their children's substance abuse potential were often grounded in awareness of genetic risk factors and prenatal substance exposure, as well as their children's mental health challenges and adoption-related loss. Parents articulated a variety of ways that they addressed risk-taking with their children, which ranged from instructive and information-focused to supportive approaches. Findings highlight how adoptive parents balance honesty about risks with fostering their children's self-esteem and positive identity development. This study illuminates the complexities of adoptive parenting in terms of managing uncertainty and promoting adolescent well-being, and underscores the role of open and ongoing communication and emotional attunement in navigating these challenges.",2025,,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,171,,,WOS:001437202800001,10.1016/j.childyouth.2025.108207,,#3833,Goldberg 2025,"",""

Exploring early age risk factors for PLEs may provide useful information for prevention of mental disorders and improvement of mental health.Method: A total of 5427 adolescents (aged between 10 and 16) participated in a cross-sectional survey, with social and demographic information collected. The Positive Subscale of Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) was used to measure PLEs, and the CAPE Depressive and Negative Subscales were used to examine depressive and negative experiences. The Trauma History Questionnaire (child version) was used to assess experiences of previous traumatic events.Results: In our study, 95.7% of the adolescents reported more than one episode of PLEs, while 17.2% reported ""nearly always"" having PLEs. High positive correlations were shown both between frequency scores among experiences of three dimensions (PLEs, depressive and negative experiences), and between frequency and distress scores. Factors associated with a higher risk for more frequent and distressing PLEs include: urban setting, family history of psychiatric illnesses, and higher impact from previous traumatic events at present.Conclusions: Episodes of PLEs are common in Chinese adolescents, however only a small proportion have persistent PLEs, with worsening distress as the frequency increased. PLEs shared similar environmental and genetic risk factors not only with the clinical phenotypes, which is consistent with the continuity model of PLEs, but also with depressive and negative experiences, which may imply etiologic relation between different dimensions of psychosis at the subclinical level.

A genome-wide association study of cocaine use disorder accounting for phenotypic heterogeneity and gene-environment interaction,"Sun, JW; Kranzler, HR; Gelernter, J; Bi, JB","Background: Phenotypic heterogeneity and complicated gene-environment interplay in etiology are among the primary factors that hinder the identification of genetic variants associated with cocaine use disorder. Methods: To detect novel genetic variants associated with cocaine use disorder, we derived disease traits with reduced phenotypic heterogeneity using cluster analysis of a study sample (n = 9965). We then used these traits in genome-wide association tests, performed separately for 2070 African Americans and 1570 European Americans, using a new mixed model that accounted for the moderating effects of 5 childhood environmental factors. We used an independent sample (918 African Americans, 1382 European Americans) for replication. Results: The cluster analysis yielded 5 cocaine use disorder subtypes, of which subtypes 4 (n = 3258) and 5 (n = 1916) comprised heavy cocaine users, had high heritability estimates (h(2) = 0.66 and 0.64, respectively) and were used in association tests. Seven of the 13 identified genetic loci in the discovery phase were available in the replication sample. In African Americans, rs114492924 (discovery p = 1.23 x E-8), a single nucleotide polymorphism in LINC01411, was replicated in the replication sample (p = 3.63 x E-3). In a meta-analysis that combined the discovery and replication results, 3 loci in African Americans were significant genome-wide: rs10188036 in TRAK2 (p = 2.95 x E-8), del 1:15511771 in TMEM51 = 9.11 x E-10) and rs149843442 near LPHN2 (p = 3.50 x E-8).

Here, we review functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies which examined task-related brain activity in young individuals with FHR-SZ and FHR-BD. A systematic search identified all published task-related fMRI studies in children, adolescents, and young adults below an age of 27 years with a first-degree relative with SZ or BD, but without manifest psychotic or affective spectrum disorder themselves. The search identified 19 cross-sectional fMRI studies covering four main cognitive domains: 1) working memory (n = 3), 2) cognitive control (n = 4), 3) reward processing (n = 3), and 4) emotion processing (n = 9). Thirteen studies included FHR-BD, five studies included FHR-SZ, and one study included a pooled FHR group. In general, task performance did not differ between the respective FHR groups and healthy controls, but 18 out of the 19 fMRI studies revealed regional alterations in task-related activation. Brain regions showing group differences in peak activation were regions associated with the respective task domain and showed little overlap between FHR-SZ and FHR-BD. The low number of studies, together with the low number of subjects, and the substantial heterogeneity of employed methodological approaches within the domain of working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing impedes finite conclusions. Emotion processing was the most investigated task domain in FHR-BD. Four studies reported differences in activation of the amygdala, and two studies reported differences in activation of inferior frontal/middle gyrus. Together, these studies provide evidence for altered brain processing of emotions in children, adolescents, and young adults at FHR-BD. More studies of higher homogeneity, larger sample sizes and with a longitudinal study design are warranted to prove a shared or specific FHR-related endophenotypic brain activation in young first-degree relatives of individuals with SZ or BD, as well as to pinpoint specific alterations in brain activation during cognitive-, emotional-, and reward-related tasks.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,11,,,WOS:000555910300001,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00632,,#3838,Johnsen 2020,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

In this review, an overview regarding the intergenerational transmission of mood disorders, screening, and preventive intervention is given for this vulnerable group.Recent findingsOffspring of parents with depression have a 40% chance of developing a depression, whereas offspring of parents with bipolar disorder have a 10% chance of developing a bipolar disorder by adulthood. Studies into the intergenerational transmission of mood disorders show that children of parents with mood disorders have increased biological dysregulation and neuropsychosocial impairments. Although there is a clear need for early identification of those at the highest risk, there are few systematic attempts in mental health care to screen children of parents with mood disorders. Lastly, preventive interventions seem to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms of children of parents with depression; however, those effects are small and short-lived.SummaryOffspring of parents with mood disorders constitute a vulnerable group at high risk of mood disorders.

In order to achieve this goal, we first need to gain a better understanding of the issues surrounding the return of complex genetic results. In this article, we summarize the current literature on: (a) genetic literacy in the general population, (b) the public's interest in receiving genetic test results for psychiatric conditions, (c) how individuals react to and interpret their genotypic information for specific psychiatric conditions, and (d) gaps in our knowledge that will be critical to address as we move toward returning genotypic information for psychiatric conditions in both research and clinical settings.

Many genetic loci have been identified for these disorders using genome-wide association studies, but conclusive evidence about cell types wherein these loci are active is lacking. We aimed to uncover implicated brain cell types in neuropsychiatric traits and to assess consistency in results across RNA datasets and methods. We therefore comprehensively employed cell type enrichment methods by integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse brain regions with an unprecedented dataset of 42 human genome-wide association study results of neuropsychiatric, substance use and behavioral/quantitative brain-related traits (n = 12,544,007 individuals). Single-cell transcriptomic datasets from the Karolinska Institute and 10x Genomics were used. Cell type enrichment was determined using Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression, Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation, and Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits. We found the largest degree of consistency across methods for implication of pyramidal cells in schizophrenia and cognitive performance. For other phenotypes, such as bipolar disorder, two methods implicated the same cell types, i.e., medium spiny neurons and pyramidal cells. For autism spectrum disorders and anorexia nervosa, no consistency in implicated cell types was observed across methods. We found no evidence for astrocytes being consistently implicated in neuropsychiatric traits.

In this study, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify the gray matter (GM) associations of individual differences in sensitivity to NLEs measured by adolescent self-rating life events checklist. Results showed that there was a positive association between individual NLEs sensitivity and regional GM volume (rGMV) in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC).

Shared environment was not a primary influence on irritability for males or females. Unique, nonshared environmental factors suggested strong effects early for males followed by an attenuating influence, whereas unique environmental factors were relatively stable for females.Conclusions: Genetic effects on irritability are developmentally dynamic from middle childhood through young adulthood, with males and females displaying differing patterns.

Familial effects account for association between chronic pain and past month smoking,"Rader, L; Reineberg, AE; Petre, B; Wager, TD; Friedman, NP","Background: Smoking is associated with chronic pain, but it is not established whether smoking causes pain or if the link is due to familial effects. One proposed mechanism is that smoking strengthens maladaptive cortico-striatal connectivity, which contributes to pain chronification. We leveraged a twin design to assess direct effects of smoking on pain controlling for familial confounds, and whether cortico-striatal connectivity mediates this association. Methods: In a population-based sample of 692 twins (age = 28.83 years), we assessed past-month smoking frequency (n = 132 used in the past month), presence and severity of a current pain episode (n = 179 yes), and resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (NAc-mPFC). Results: Smoking was significantly associated with pain, but the association was not significantly mediated by NAc-mPFC connectivity. In a co-twin control model, smoking predicted which families had more pain but could not distinguish pain between family members. Pain risk was 43% due to additive genetic (A) and 57% due to non-shared environmental (E) influences. Past-month smoking frequency was 71% genetic and 29% non-shared environmental. Smoking and pain significantly correlated phenotypically (r = 0.21, p = 0.001) and genetically (r(g) = 0.51, p < 0.001), but not environmentally (r(e) = -0.18, p = 0.339).

Cannabis in Adolescence: Lasting Cognitive Alterations and Underlying Mechanisms,"Scheyer, AF; Laviolette, SR; Pelissier, AL; Manzoni, OJJ","Cannabis consumption during adolescence is an area of particular concern, owing to changes in the social and political perception of the drug, and presents a scientific, medical, and economic challenge. Major social and economic interests continue to push toward cannabis legalization as well as pharmaceutical development. As a result, shifting perceptions of both legal and illicit cannabis use across the population have changed the collective evaluation of the potential dangers of the product. The wave of cannabis legalization therefore comes with new responsibility to educate the public on potential risks and known dangers associated with both recreational and medical cannabis. Among these is the risk of long-term cognitive and psychological consequences, particularly following early-life initiation of use, compounded by high-potency and/or synthetic cannabis, and heavy/frequent use of the drug. Underlying these cognitive and psychiatric consequences are lasting aberrations in the development of synaptic function, often secondary to epigenetic changes. Additional factors such as genetic risk and environmental influences or nondrug toxic insults during development are also profound contributors to these long-term functional alterations following adolescent cannabis use.

Genotype data collected from 721 participants in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (45% males) were used to derive polygenic scores for aggression (PGSAGG) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (PGSADHD). PA was reported annually or biennially on six occasions between ages 6 and 13 by distinct teachers. Mothers reported EXT (PA, hyperactivity, opposition) and adverse experiences (peer difficulties and harsh parenting) on three occasions between ages 3 1/2 and 5. Both PGSs proved significant predictors of school-age PA. However, no early behaviors or adverse experiences mediated the association between PGSAGG and school-age PA. Contrastingly, hyperactivity and opposition each partially mediated the association between PGSADHD and school-age PA. Notably, when both mediators were included in the same model, only hyperactivity remained significant. This study contributes to identifying early manifestations of genetic risk for PA, which may serve as early targets for intervention.",2025,,EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY,,,,WOS:001415183300001,10.1007/s00787-025-02654-4,,#3866,Bouliane 2025,"",""

However, the relationship between shared symptoms and shared genetic liability is still poorly understood. AimsWell-characterised, cross-disorder samples are needed to investigate this matter, but few currently exist. Our aim is to develop procedures to purposely curate and aggregate genotypic and phenotypic data in psychiatric research.

Weight gain and increase of body mass index among children and adolescents treated with antipsychotics: a critical review,"Martínez-Ortega, JM; Funes-Godoy, S; Díaz-Atienza, F; Gutiérrez-Rojas, L; Pérez-Costillas, L; Gurpegui, M","We performed an updated review of the available literature on weight gain and increase of body mass index (BMI) among children and adolescents treated with antipsychotic medications. A PubMed search was conducted specifying the following MeSH terms: (antipsychotic agents) hedged with (weight gain) or (body mass index). We selected 127 reports, including 71 intervention trials, 42 observational studies and 14 literature reviews. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), in comparison with first-generation antipsychotics, are associated with a greater risk for antipsychotic-induced weight gain although this oversimplification should be clarified by distinguishing across different antipsychotic drugs. Among SGAs, olanzapine appears to cause the most significant weight gain, while ziprasidone seems to cause the least. Antipsychotic-induced BMI increase appears to remain regardless of the specific psychotropic co-treatment. Children and adolescents seem to be at a greater risk than adults for antipsychotic-induced weight gain; and the younger the child, the higher the risk. Genetic or environmental factors related to antipsychotic-induced weight gain among children and adolescents are mostly unknown, although certain genetic factors related to serotonin receptors or hormones such as leptin, adiponectin or melanocortin may be involved. Strategies to reduce this antipsychotic side effect include switching to another antipsychotic drug, lowering the dosage or initiating treatment with metformin or topiramate, as well as non-pharmacological interventions.

Early Life Predictors of Adult Depression in a Community Cohort of Urban African Americans,"Green, KM; Fothergill, KE; Robertson, JA; Zebrak, KA; Banda, DR; Ensminger, ME","Depression among African Americans residing in urban communities is a complex, major public health problem; however, few studies identify early life risk factors for depression among urban African American men and women. To better inform prevention programming, this study uses data from the Woodlawn Study, a well-defined community cohort of urban African Americans followed from age 6 to 42 years, to determine depression prevalence through midlife and identify childhood and adolescent risk factors for adult depression separately by gender. Results indicate that lifetime depression rates do not differ significantly by gender (16.2 % of men, 18.8 % of women) in contrast to findings of a higher prevalence for women in national studies. Furthermore, rates of depression in this urban African American population are higher than those found in national samples of African Americans and more comparable to the higher rates found nationally among Whites. Regarding early predictors, for both men and women, family conflict in adolescence is a risk factor for adult depression in multivariate regression models. For women, vulnerability to depression has roots in early life, specifically, low maternal aspirations for school attainment. Females displaying more aggressive and delinquent behavior and those growing up in a female-headed household and a household with low maternal education have elevated rates of depression. Males growing up in persistent poverty, those engaging in greater delinquent behavior, and those with low parental supervision in adolescence also have elevated rates of depression.

The predictive power of family history measures of alcohol and drug problems and internalizing disorders in a college population,"Kendler, KS; Edwards, A; Myers, J; Cho, SB; Adkins, A; Dick, D","A family history (FH) of psychiatric and substance use problems is a potent risk factor for common internalizing and externalizing disorders. In a large web-based assessment of mental health in college students, we developed a brief set of screening questions for a FH of alcohol problems (AP), drug problems (DP) and depression-anxiety in four classes of relatives (father, mother, aunts/uncles/grandparents, and siblings) as reported by the student. Positive reports of a history of AP, DP, and depression-anxiety were substantially correlated within relatives. These FH measures predicted in the student, in an expected pattern, dimensions of personality and impulsivity, alcohol consumption and problems, smoking and nicotine dependence, use of illicit drugs, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Using the mean score from the four classes of relatives was more predictive than using a familial/sporadic dichotomy. Interactions were seen between the FH of AP, DP, and depression-anxiety and peer deviance in predicting symptoms of alcohol and tobacco dependence. As the students aged, the FH of AP became a stronger predictor of alcohol problems. While we cannot directly assess the validity of these FH reports, the pattern of findings suggest that our brief screening items were able to assess, with some accuracy, the FH of substance misuse and internalizing psychiatric disorders in relatives. If correct, these measures can play an important role in the creation of developmental etiologic models for substance and internalizing psychiatric disorders which constitute one of the central goals of the overall project.

Most anxiety disorders affect almost twice as many women as men. They often co- occur with major depression, alcohol and other substance- use disorders, and personality disorders. Differential diagnosis from physical conditions- including thyroid, cardiac, and respiratory disorders, and substance intoxication and withdrawal- is imperative. If untreated, anxiety disorders tend to recur chronically.

The effects of maternal depression on their perception of emotional and behavioral problems of their internationally adopted children,"Liskola, K; Raaska, H; Lapinleimu, H; Lipsanen, J; Sinkkonen, J; Elovainio, M","Background Even though child psychopathology assessment guidelines emphasize comprehensive multi-method, multimodal, and multi-informant methodologies, maternal-report symptom-rating scales often serve as the predominant source of information. Research has shown that parental mood symptomatology affects their reports of their offspring's psychopathology. For example, the depression-distortion hypothesis suggests that maternal depression promotes a negative bias in mothers' perceptions of their children's behavioral and emotional problems. We investigated this difference of perception between adoptive mothers and internationally adopted children. Most previous studies suffer from the potential bias caused by the fact that parents and children share genetic risks. Methods Data were derived from the Finnish Adoption (FinAdo) survey study (a subsample of adopted children aged between 9 and 12 years, n = 222). The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess emotional and behavioral problems and competences of the adopted children. The CBCL was filled in by the adopted children and the adoptive mothers, respectively. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the short version of the General Health Questionnaire. Results On average, mothers reported less total CBCL symptoms in their children than the children themselves (0.25 vs 0.38, p-value < 0.01 for difference). Mothers' depressive symptoms moderated the discrepancy in reporting internalizing symptoms (beta = - 0.14 and p-value 0.01 for interaction) and the total symptoms scores (beta = - 0.22 and p-value < 0.001 for interaction) and externalizing symptoms in girls in the CBCL. Limitations The major limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design and the fact that we only collected data in the form of questionnaires.

Data were analyzed on compulsive Internet use [with the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS)] from 5247 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) adolescent twins registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. The participants form a sample that is informative for genetic analyses, allowing the investigation of the causes of individual differences in compulsive Internet use. The internal consistency of the instrument was high and the 1.6-year test-retest correlation in a subsample (n=902) was 0.55. CIUS scores increased slightly with age. Remarkably, gender did not explain variation in CIUS scores, as mean scores on the CIUS were the same in boys and girls. However, the time spent on specific Internet activities differed: boys spent more time on gaming, whereas girls spent more time on social network sites and chatting. The heritability estimates were the same for boys and girls: 48percent of the individual differences in CIUS score were influenced by genetic factors.

Furthermore, impairment of cognitive functions, such as working memory and emotion regulation, has also been linked to psychosis risk as well as to disruptions in several brain regions. However, impairments in these domains have also been linked to other disorders, including depression. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether neural impairments in regions associated with working memory and implicit emotion regulation impairments are specific to PLEs versus depression.METHODS: The current study used an emotional n-back task to examine the relationship between childhood PLEs and neural activation of regions involved in both working memory and implicit emotion regulation using data from 8805 9- to 11-year-olds in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study 2.0 release. To examine specificity, we also analyzed associations with depressive symptoms.RESULTS: Our results indicated that increased PLEs during middle childhood were associated with decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striatum, and pallidum during trials requiring working memory. In contrast, increased activation of the parahippocampus, caudate, nucleus accumbens, and rostral anterior cingulate during face-viewing trials was associated with increased depressive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the dimensional view of psychosis across the lifespan, providing evidence that neural correlates of PLEs, such as decreased activation during working memory, are present during middle childhood.

"Parental emotional warmth, self-control and adolescent prosocial behavior: The moderating role of multilocus genetic and parental gender differences","Nie, YG; Chen, P; Wang, LX; Yu, CF; Li, ZH","Previous quantitative genetic studies have demonstrated that adolescent self-control is influenced by parenting and genetics. In most existing studies, researchers have explored only the impact of the interaction between a single gene and parental factors on adolescent prosocial behaviour, but exploration of the endophenotype mechanism underlying the impact of the interaction between genes and the environment on prosocial behaviour is lacking. According to social cognitive models of prosocial behaviors, sociocognitive and socioemotive traits may be important mediators of environmental and genetic interactions on individual behaviors. In recent years, the single-polymorphism GxE design has been criticized for unreliable findings and difficult replication. As a potential solution, researchers have constructed multilocus genetic profile scores MGPSs) to explore how environmental factors interact with genetic factors to predict adolescent development. Therefore, this study examined self-control as a mediator of the link between parental emotional warmth and adolescents' prosocial behavior. Furthermore, this study developed an MGPS composed of five functional SNPs (COMT gene rs6269, HTR2A gene rs6313, OXTR gene rs53576, OXTR gene rs2254295, and OXTR gene rs2254298) and examined whether the MGPS moderates the mediating effect of self-control. Using a 2-time longitudinal design (6 months apart), this study recruited 880 adolescents by cluster sampling at T1 in Guangzhou, China. All adolescents completed questionnaires about parental emotional warmth, prosocial behavior, and demographic characteristics and provided saliva samples for DNA extraction. At T2, 723 adolescents remained in the study and reported their prosocial behavior and self-control. All polymorphisms were genotyped using SNaPshot analysis (Applied Biosystems). After controlling for the baseline levels of prosocial behavior, parental emotional warmth positively and significantly predicted adolescents' prosocial behavior. Self-control mediated the link between parental emotional warmth and adolescents' prosocial behavior. Furthermore, the MGPS moderated the mediating mechanism but not the direct impact of parental emotional warmth on adolescents' prosocial behavior, and the model coefficients were invariant for mothers and fathers. Specifically, the MGPS moderated the effect of parental emotional warmth on self-control such that the effect was stronger in adolescents with higher MGPS than in those with lower MGPS. For adolescents with higher MGPS, parental emotional warmth was related to higher levels of self-control, which in turn increased prosocial behavior. However, this mediating effect was not observed among adolescents with lower MGPS.

INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS AND BEHAVIORAL GENETICS: DELAYED REWARD DISCOUNTING AS AN ENDOPHENOTYPE FOR ADDICTIVE DISORDERS,"MacKillop, J","Delayed reward discounting is a behavioral economic index of impulsivity, referring to how much an individual devalues a reward based on its delay in time. As a behavioral process that varies considerably across individuals, delay discounting has been studied extensively as a model for self-control, both in the general population and in clinical samples. There is growing interest in genetic influences on discounting and, in particular, the prospect of discounting as an endophenotype for addictive disorders (i.e., a heritable mechanism partially responsible for conferring genetic risk). This review assembles and critiques the evidence supporting this hypothesis. Via numerous cross-sectional studies and a small number of longitudinal studies, there is considerable evidence that impulsive discounting is associated with addictive behavior and appears to play an etiological role. Moreover, there is increasing evidence from diverse methodologies that impulsive delay discounting is temporally stable, heritable, and that elevated levels are present in nonaffected family members. These findings suggest that impulsive discounting meets the criteria for being considered an endophenotype. In addition, recent findings suggest that genetic variation related to dopamine neurotransmission is significantly associated with variability in discounting preferences. A significant caveat, however, is that the literature is modest in some domains and, in others, not all the findings have been supportive or consistent. In addition, important methodological considerations are necessary in future studies. Taken together, although not definitive, there is accumulating support for the hypothesis of impulsive discounting as an endophenotype for addictive behavior and a need for further systematic investigation.",2013,,JOURNAL OF THE EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR,99,1,14-31,WOS:000319862600003,10.1002/jeab.4,,#3928,MacKillop 2013,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Genetic influences on adolescent behavior also show marked changes across this developmental period; in fact, adolescence showcases the dynamic nature of genetic influences on human behavior. Using the twin studies literature on alcohol use and misuse, we highlight several principles of genetic influence on adolescent behavior. We illustrate how genetic influences change (increase) across adolescence, as individuals have more freedom to express their predispositions and to shape their social worlds. We show how there are multiple genetic pathways to risk, and how the environment can moderate the importance of genetic predispositions. Finally, we review the literature aimed at identifying specific genes involved in adolescent behavior and understanding how identified genes impact adolescent outcomes. Ultimately, understanding how genetic predispositions combine with environmental influences to impact pathways of risk and resilience should be translated into improved prevention and intervention efforts; this remains a rich area for future research.

Sociodemographic and cultural determinants of mood disorders,"D'cruz, MM; Chaturvedi, SK","Purpose of review The present review aims to examine, summarize and update information on the sociodemographic and cultural determinants of mood disorders. Recent findings Known sociodemographic and cultural determinants continue to be good predictors of the risk of developing a mood disorder over the lifetime. Polygenic risk scores do not appear to offer any advantages over these determinants at present. There is also new and emerging understanding of the role of lifestyle and environmental factors in mediating vulnerability to mood disorder. The influence of ethnicity and migration, on the other hand, is far more complex than initially envisaged. Recent evidence on sociodemographic determinants of mood disorders confirms associations derived from existing literature. There is also new and emerging evidence on how quality of sleep, diet and the environment influence risk of mood disorders. Culture and ethnicity, depending on context, may contribute to both vulnerability and resilience. Socioeconomic deprivation may be the final common pathway through which several sociodemographic and cultural determinants of mood disorders act.",2022,,CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY,35,1,38-44,WOS:000725147400007,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000766,,#3937,D'cruz 2022,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

"Offspring of parents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression: a review of familial high-risk and molecular genetics studies","Sandstrom, A; Sahiti, Q; Pavlova, B; Uher, R","Offspring of parents with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, have a one-in-three risk of developing severe mental illness themselves. Over the last 60 years, three waves of familial high-risk studies examined the development of severe mental illness in offspring of affected parents. The first two waves established familial nature of schizophrenia, and demonstrated early impairment in offspring of affected parents. The most recent wave has added a focus on mood disorders and examined the transdiagnostic nature of familial risk. A synthesis of current knowledge on individuals at familial risk points to psychopathology, neurocognitive, neuroanatomical, and environmental factors involved in the familial transmission of severe mental illness. Although family history remains the single strongest predictor of illness, molecular genetic tools are becoming increasingly informative. The next decade may see family history and molecular genetics complementing each other to facilitate a transdiagnostic approach to early risk identification and prevention.

Repeated salivary daytime cortisol and onset of mood episodes in offspring of bipolar parents,"Goodday, S; Horrocks, J; Keown-Stoneman, C; Grof, P; Duffy, A","Differences in cortisol secretion may differentiate individuals at high compared to low genetic risk for bipolar disorder (BD) and predict the onset or recurrence of mood episodes. The objectives of this study were to determine if salivary cortisol measures are: (1) different in high-risk offspring of parents with BD (HR) compared to control offspring of unaffected parents (C), (2) stable over time, (3) associated with the development of mood episode onset/recurrence, and (4) influenced by comorbid complications.Fifty-three HR and 22 C completed salivary cortisol sampling annually for up to 4 years in conjunction with semi-structured clinical interviews. The cortisol awakening response (CAR), daytime cortisol [area under the curve (AUC)], and evening cortisol (8:00 p.m.) were calculated.There were no differences in baseline CAR, AUC and evening cortisol between HR and C (p = 0.38, p = 0.30 and p = 0.84), respectively. CAR, AUC and evening cortisol were stable over yearly assessments in HR, while in Cs, evening cortisol increased over time (p = 0.008), and CAR and AUC remained stable. In HR, AUC and evening cortisol increased the hazard of a new onset mood disorder/recurrence by 2.7 times (p = 0.01), and 3.5 times (p = 0.01), respectively, but this was no longer significant after accounting for multiple comparisons.Salivary cortisol is stable over time within HR offspring.

Polygenic Risk for Aggression Predicts Adult Substance Use Disorder Diagnoses via Substance Use Offending in Emerging Adulthood and is Moderated by a Family-Centered Intervention,"Elam, KK; Mun, CJ; Kutzner, J; Ha, T","A substance use offense reflects an encounter with law enforcement and the court system in response to breaking the law which may increase risk for substance use problems later in life. Individuals may also be at risk for substance use offending and substance use problems based on genetic predisposition. We examined a mediation model in which polygenic risk for aggression predicted adult substance use disorder diagnoses (SUD) via substance use offending in emerging adulthood. In addition, we explored for potential attenuation of genetic influences on these outcomes by a family-based intervention, the Family Check-Up (FCU). Secondary data analyses based upon the Project Alliance 1 sample was conducted among those with genetic data (n = 631; 322 from control and 309 from FCU intervention). The sample was ethnically diverse (30% African American, 44% European American, 6% Latinx, 4% Asian American, 3% Native American, and 13% Other). Greater polygenic risk for aggression was found to increase risk for substance use violations (age 19-23), which in turn was associated with greater likelihood of being diagnosed with SUD at age 27. A gene-by-intervention effect was found in which individuals in the control group had greater risk for SUD with increasing polygenic risk for aggression. Some convergence in results was found when replicating analyses in African American and European American subgroups. Results imply that genetic predisposition may increase risk for problematic substance use later in life via antisocial behavior, such as substance use offending, and that this can be attenuated by a family-centered intervention.",2021,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,51,5,607-618,WOS:000660429600001,10.1007/s10519-021-10070-y,,#3954,Elam 2021,"",""

Investigating regions of shared genetic variation in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and major depressive disorder: a GWAS meta-analysis,"Powell, V; Martin, J; Thapar, A; Rice, F; Anney, RJL","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) demonstrates a high level of comorbidity with major depressive disorder (MDD). One possible contributor to this is that the two disorders show high genetic correlation. However, the specific regions of the genome that may be responsible for this overlap are unclear. To identify variants associated with both ADHD and MDD, we performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of ADHD and MDD. All genome wide significant (p<5x10(-8)) SNPs in the meta-analysis that were also strongly associated (p<5x10(-4)) independently with each disorder were followed up. These putatively pleiotropic SNPs were tested for additional associations across a broad range of phenotypes. Fourteen linkage disequilibrium-independent SNPs were associated with each disorder separately (p<5x10(-4)) and in the cross-disorder meta-analysis (p<5x10(-8)). Nine of these SNPs had not been highlighted previously in either individual GWAS. Evidence supported nine of the fourteen SNPs acting as eQTL and two as brain eQTL. Index SNPs and their genomic regions demonstrated associations with other mental health phenotypes.

"Associations between breakfast skipping and outcomes in neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive performance, and frailty: a Mendelian randomization study","Zhang, Z; Tan, JL; Luo, QH","Background Prior studies have identified a correlation between breakfast skipping and a heightened risk of mental health issues. This investigation aimed to employ a Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to explore the potential causal links between breakfast skipping and various psychiatric, neurological disorders, cognitive performance, and frailty. Methods Utilizing data from genome-wide association studies within European demographics, this research scrutinized the association between breakfast habits and several neuropsychiatric conditions and physical health outcomes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Narcolepsy, Insomnia, cognitive performance, and frailty. In this MR analysis, the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method was primarily utilized for evaluation. Outcomes were reported as Odds Ratios (OR) and regression coefficients (beta), and underwent validation through False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections, thereby offering a rigorous evaluation of the effects of breakfast habits on both mental and physical health dimensions. Results Findings demonstrate a significant causal link between skipping breakfast and an increased risk of ADHD (OR = 2.74, 95%CI: 1.54-4.88, P-FDR = 0.003) and MDD (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.22-2.37, P-FDR = 0.005). Conversely, no substantial causal associations were identified between breakfast skipping and AD, BD, narcolepsy, or insomnia (P-FDR > 0.05). Moreover, a notable causal relationship was established between skipping breakfast and a reduction in cognitive performance (beta = -0.16, 95%CI: -0.29-0.04,P-FDR = 0.024) and an increase in frailty (beta = 0.29, 95%CI: 0.12-0.45, P-FDR = 0.003). Conclusion The MR analysis reveals that skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of ADHD, MDD, decreased cognitive performance, and greater frailty, while showing no associations were found with AD, BD, narcolepsy, or insomnia.

Early risk factors for adult bipolar disorder in adolescents with mood disorders: a 15-year follow-up of a community sample,"Päären, A; Bohman, H; von Knorring, L; Olsson, G; von Knorring, AL; Jonsson, U","Background: We aimed to outline the early risk factors for adult bipolar disorder (BPD) in adolescents with mood disorders.Methods: Adolescents (16-17 years old) with mood disorders (n = 287; 90 participants with hypomania spectrum episodes and 197 with major depressive disorder [MDD]) were identified from a community sample. Fifteen years later (at 30-33 years of age), mood episodes were assessed (n = 194). The risk of developing BPD (n = 22), compared with MDD (n = 104) or no mood episodes in adulthood (n = 68), was estimated via logistic regression. Adolescent mood symptoms, non-mood disorders, and family characteristics were assessed as potential risk factors.Results: Among the adolescents with mood disorders, a family history of BPD was the strongest predictor of developing BPD compared with having no mood episodes in adulthood (OR = 5.94; 95% CI = 1.11-31.73), whereas disruptive disorders significantly increased the risk of developing BPD compared with developing MDD (OR = 2.94; CI = 1.06-8.12). The risk that adolescents with MDD would develop adult BPD, versus having no mood episodes in adulthood, was elevated among those with an early disruptive disorder (OR = 3.62; CI = 1.09-12.07) or multiple somatic symptoms (OR = 6.60; CI = 1.70-25.67).

Knowledge and Awareness about the Connection between Lifestyle and Dementia among Adolescents,"Arora, D; Devi, RG; Priya, AJ","Background and Aim: Dementia is a group of symptoms characterized by memory loss, judgemental loss, forgetfulness. Dementia cannot be cured; but can be prevented. There are seven stages of Dementia, no cognitive decline being the first stage to very severe cognitive decline being the seventh stage. Healthy lifestyle is important for lower risk of Dementia. Smoking, consumption of alcohol, negative thinking, depression, stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, unhealthy diet causes Dementia. Diet plays a very important role in prevention of dementia; foods such as red meat, sugar, fatty foods can increase the risk of dementia whereas foods rich in fibres, fruits can reduce the risk of Dementia. The main aim of this study is to assess the knowledge about lifestyle and dementia.Materials and Methods: This is a cross sectional survey. 121 adolescents of Saveetha Dental College, Chennai participated in the survey which was conducted through Google forms in February 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 19 questions. The data was analyzed with the help of SPSS software and chi-square test was done for the correlation between gender and awareness. Chi-square test was done for the correlation of gender with awareness among the population. 'p-value' was calculated and value < 0.05 was considered as significant.Results: Out of that 62 were females and 59 were males. Females were more aware about healthy lifestyles and its connection with dementia than males. 92.56% of people were aware that physical activity promotes a healthy brain. 69.2% agreed that depression can increase risk of Dementia. Majority of them agreed that physical exercise can promote a healthy brain.Conclusion: This study revealed that lifestyle is highly associated with dementia among adolescents. Healthy lifestyle leads to lower risk of dementia even if there's high genetic risk. Females were aware about the diet which is healthy for lower risk of dementia and more smoking affects the memory.

Higher breast cancer-specific distress among adolescent girls was associated with higher self-perceived risk of breast cancer and higher maternal breast cancer-specific distress.ConclusionAdolescent girls from BRCA1/2-positive and breast cancer families have higher self-esteem and do not have poorer psychosocial adjustment than peers. However, they do experience greater breast cancer-specific distress and perceived risk of breast cancer, particularly among older girls. Understanding the impact is important to optimize responses to growing up in families at familial and genetic risk for breast cancer, particularly given the debate over the genetic testing of children for cancer susceptibility in adulthood.

Evaluation of bidirectional relationships between risk preference and mood disorders: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Guo, WL; Zhao, YX; Liu, J; Zhou, JS; Wang, XP","Background: Risk preference is often defined as the tendency to engage in risky activities. Increasing evidence shows that risk preference is associated with mood disorders. However, the causality and direction of this association are not clear. Methods: Genome-wide association study summary data of risk preference in 939,908 participants from UK Biobank and 23andMe were used to identify general risk preference. Data for 413,466 individuals taken from The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to identify bipolar disorder (BP). Data for 807,553 individuals taken from The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to identify major depressive disorder (MDD). The weighted median, inverse-variance weighting, and Mendelian randomization-Egger methods were used for the Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate a causal effect and detect directional pleiotropy. Results: GWAS summary data were obtained from three combined samples, containing 939,908, 413,466 and 807,553 individuals of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested that risk preference increased the onset of BP, and BP also increased risk preference (P < 0.001). In contrast, there were no reliable results to describe the relationship of risk preference with MDD (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between MDD and risk preference. Conclusion: Using large-scale GWAS data, robust evidence supports a mutual relationship between risk preference and BP, but no relationship between risk preference and MDD was observed. This study indicates a potential marker for the early identification of MDD and BP. Additionally, it shows that reducing risk preferences for patients with BP may be a valuable intervention for treating BP.",2024,,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,347,,526-532,WOS:001160821300001,10.1016/j.jad.2023.12.018,,#3977,Guo 2024,"",""
"Neuroticism developmental courses - implications for depression, anxiety and everyday emotional experience; a prospective study from adolescence to young adulthood","Aldinger, M; Stopsack, M; Ulrich, I; Appel, K; Reinelt, E; Wolff, S; Grabe, HJ; Lang, S; Barnow, S","Background: Neuroticism is frequently discussed as a risk factor for psychopathology. According to the maturity principle, neuroticism decreases over the course of life, but not uniformly across individuals. However, the implications of differences in personality maturation on mental health have not been well studied so far. Hence, we hypothesized that different forms of neuroticism development from adolescence to young adulthood are associated with differences in depression, anxiety and everyday emotional experience at the age of 25.Methods: A sample of 266 adolescents from the general population was examined three times over ten years (age at T-0: 15, T-1: 20 and T-2: 25) using questionnaires, interviews and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). At all measurement points, neuroticism was assessed with the NEO inventory. At T-2, diagnoses of major depression and anxiety disorders were captured with a structured clinical interview (M-CIDI). Phone-based EMA was used to assess emotional experience and affective instability over a two-week period at T-2.Results: The best fitting model was a latent class growth analysis with two groups of neuroticism development. Most individuals (n = 205) showed moderate values whereas 61 participants were clustered into a group with elevated neuroticism levels. In both groups neuroticism significantly changed during the ten year period with a peak at the age of 20. Individuals with a higher absolute level were at 14-fold increased risk for depression and 7-fold risk for anxiety disorders at the age of 25. In EMA, increased negative affect and arousal as well as decreased positive emotions were found in this high group.Conclusions: Other than expected, personality did not mature in our sample. However, there was a significant change of neuroticism values from adolescence to young adulthood. Further, over 20% of our participants showed a neuroticism development which was associated with adverse outcomes such as negatively toned emotional experience and a heightened risk to suffer from depressive and anxiety disorders in young adulthood. These high-risk persons need to be identified early to provide interventions supporting continuous personality maturation.",2014,,BMC PSYCHIATRY,14,,,WOS:000341527200001,10.1186/s12888-014-0210-2,,#3978,Aldinger 2014,"",""
Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents and Young Adults at High Risk for Psychosis: Results of a Randomized Trial,"Miklowitz, DJ; O'Brien, MP; Schlosser, DA; Addington, J; Candan, KA; Marshall, C; Domingues, I; Walsh, BC; Zinberg, JL; De Silva, SD; Friedman-Yakoobian, M; Cannon, TD","Objective: Longitudinal studies have begun to clarify the phenotypic characteristics of adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis. This 8-site randomized trial examined whether a 6-month program of family psychoeducation was effective in reducing the severity of attenuated positive and negative psychotic symptoms and enhancing functioning among individuals at high risk. Method: Adolescents and young adults (mean age 17.4 +/- 4.1 years) with attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, brief and intermittent psychosis, or genetic risk with functional deterioration were randomly assigned to 18 sessions of family-focused therapy for individuals at clinical high risk (FFT-CHR) in 6 months or 3 sessions of family psychoeducation (enhanced care [EC]. FFT-CHR included psychoeducation about early signs of psychosis, stress management, communication training, and problem-solving skills training, whereas EC focused on symptom prevention. Independent evaluators assessed participants at baseline and 6 months on positive and negative symptoms and social-role functioning. Results: Of 129 participants, 102 (79.1%) were followed up at 6 months. Participants in FFT-CHR showed greater improvements in attenuated positive symptoms over 6 months than participants in EC (F-1,F-97 = 5.49, p = .02). Negative symptoms improved independently of psychosocial treatments. Changes in psychosocial functioning depended on age: participants more than 19 years of age showed more role improvement in FFT-CHR, whereas participants between 16 and 19 years of age showed more role improvement in EC. The results were independent of concurrent pharmacotherapy. Conclusion: Interventions that focus on improving family relationships may have prophylactic efficacy in individuals at high risk for psychosis. Future studies should examine the specificity of effects of family intervention compared to individual therapy of the same duration and frequency.

"Suicidal ideation and aggression in childhood, genetic variation and young adult depression","Hill, SY; Jones, BL; Haas, GL","Background: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors have been studied in association with a variety of risk factors. The aim of the present study was to determine if levels of child/adolescent aggression and/or variation in candidate genes previously associated with suicidal behaviors in adults would influence the presence of suicidal ideation in childhood/adolescence, and to determine if ideation was associated with young adult depression.Methods: A longitudinal study of children, adolescents and young adults who were at high or low risk for alcohol and other substance use disorders by familial background were assessed. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) aggression scale scores with derived subtypes (physical and relational) and genetic variation (ANKK1, DRD2, COMT, SLC6A4, HTR2C) were used as predictors of the presence and onset of suicidal ideation in childhood using survival analysis. Structural equation models (SEM) were fit to determine the relative importance of the predictors controlling for background variables.Results: CBCL aggression was significantly associated with child/adolescent suicidal ideation. One SNP in the ANKK1 gene (rs1800497), one in the HTR2C gene (rs6318), and two haplotypes, AAAC in the ANKK1-DRD2 complex and the CCC haplotype of the HTR2C gene, were significantly associated with the presence and onset of child/adolescent suicidal ideation. Follow up in young adulthood showed a significant relationship between suicidal ideation in childhood/adolescence and young adult depression.Conclusions: Genetic variation and presence of elevated aggression scores from the childhood CBCL are significant predictors of childhood suicidal ideation.

Four modifiable factors that mediate the effect of educational time on major depressive disorder risk: A network Mendelian randomization study,"Wan, BB; Wu, YM; Ma, N; Zhou, Z; Lu, WY","BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental illness, which is a notable public health problem that aggravates the global economic burden. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between education and MDD risk and the contributions of effects mediated by four modifiable factors. Materials and methodsInstrumental variables were screened from several large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (years of schooling with 766,345 participants, MDD with 59,851 cases and 113,154 controls, neuroticism with 329,821 individuals, smoking behavior with 195,068 cases and 164,638 controls, body mass index [BMI] with 336,107 individuals, and household income with 397,751 individuals). The data were used to evaluate the association of the four modifiable factors (neuroticism, smoking behavior, BMI, and household income) that mediate the effect of education on MDD risk via Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. ResultsEach standard deviation increase in years of schooling could reduce the risk for MDD by 30.70%. Higher neuroticism and BMI were associated with a higher risk of MDD. Non-smoking status and increased household income were protective factors for MDD. Notably, the mediator neuroticism, BMI, smoking behavior, and household income explained 52.92%, 15.54%, 31.86%, and 81.30% of the effect of years of schooling on MDD risk, respectively. ConclusionsLonger years of schooling have a protective effect on MDD risk. Reasonable interventions to reduce neuroticism, BMI, smoking, and increasing household income are beneficial for MDD prevention.

The genetics of alcohol dependence,"Rietschel, M; Treutlein, J","Alcohol consumption dates back to the Neolithic period, and alcohol dependence contributes substantially to the current global burden of disease. Despite this, optimal therapies and preventive strategies are lacking. Formal genetic studies of alcohol dependence have shown that genetic factors play as large a role in disease etiology as environmental factors. Molecular genetic studies may identify causal factors and facilitate the development of novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. Whereas earlier studies involved the use of linkage- and candidate-gene approaches, recent years have witnessed the introduction of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The present review provides a brief overview of the findings of formal genetic studies, summarizes the results of earlier molecular-genetic investigations, and presents a detailed overview of all published GWAS in the field of alcohol dependence research. To date, few genome-wide significant findings have been reported.

However, most studies on this topic have focused on adult samples, and little is known regarding comorbid ED among youth with BD. Methods: The sample included 197 youth with DSM-IV BD (BD-I, BD-II, or BD-NOS [not otherwise specified]), aged 13-20 years and recruited from a subspecialized clinic within a tertiary academic health sciences center from 2009 to 2017. Univariate analyses examined demographic and clinical variables among participants with versus without lifetime DSM-IV ED. Variables significant at P <.10 were entered into a backward stepwise regression. Results: Fifty-six participants (28.4%) had lifetime DSM-IV ED (3.6% anorexia nervosa, 8.1% bulimia nervosa, 16.8% ED not otherwise specified). Significant correlates of lifetime ED were female sex (P <.001), BD-II subtype (P =.03), suicidal ideation (P =.006), suicide attempts (P =.004), non-suicidal self-injury (P <.001), sexual abuse (P =.02), cigarette smoking (P =.001), anxiety disorders (P =.004), posttraumatic stress disorder (P =.004), substance use disorders (P =.006), history of individual therapy (P =.01), and family history of anxiety (P =.01). Significant correlates of no lifetime ED were BD-I subtype (P <.001) and lifetime lithium use (P =.01). The ED group had significantly more severe lifetime depression (P <.001) and significantly more self-reported affective lability (P <.001) and borderline personality traits (P <.001). In multivariate analysis, the most robust predictors of lifetime ED were female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61, P =.004), BD-I subtype (OR = 0.21, P =.03), cigarette smoking (OR = 2.78, P =.02), individual therapy (OR = 3.92, P =.03), family history of anxiety (OR = 2.86, P =.02), and borderline personality traits (OR = 1.01, P =.009).

Discovering novel biomarkers to identify individuals who are at high risk is very much needed. Our previous work shows that the microRNA miR-218 mediates susceptibility to stress and depression in adulthood by targeting the netrin-1 guidance cue receptor gene Dcc in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).METHODS: Here, we investigated whether miR-218 regulates Dcc expression in adolescence and could serve as an early predictor of lifetime stress vulnerability in male mice.RESULTS: miR-218 expression in the mPFC increases from early adolescence to adulthood and correlates negatively with Dcc levels. In blood, postnatal miR-218 expression parallels changes occurring in the mPFC. Notably, circulating miR-218 levels in adolescence associate with vulnerability to social defeat stress in adulthood, with high levels associated with social avoidance severity. Indeed, downregulation of miR-218 in the mPFC in adolescence promotes resilience to stress in adulthood.CONCLUSIONS: miR-218 expression in adolescence may serve both as a marker of risk and as a target for early interventions.",2021,,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,89,9,911-919,WOS:000639543100012,10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.10.015,,#3993,Torres-Berrío 2021,"",""
"Common Etiological Sources of Anxiety, Depression, and Somatic Complaints in Adolescents: A Multiple Rater twin Study","Ask, H; Waaktaar, T; Seglem, KB; Torgersen, S","Somatic complaints in children and adolescents may be considered part of a broader spectrum of internalizing disorders that include anxiety and depression. Previous research on the topic has focused mainly on the relationship between anxiety and depression without investigating how common somatic symptoms relate to an underlying factor and its etiology. Based on the classical twin design with monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together, our study aimed to explore the extent to which the covariation between three phenotypes in adolescent girls and boys can be represented by a latent internalizing factor, with a focus on both common and specific etiological sources. A population-based sample of twins aged 12-18 years and their mothers and fathers (N = 1394 families) responded to questionnaire items measuring the three phenotypes. Informants' ratings were collapsed using full information maximum likelihood estimated factor scores. Multivariate genetic analyses were conducted to examine the etiological structure of concurrent symptoms. The best fitting model was an ACE common pathway model without sex limitation and with one substantially heritable (44 %) latent factor shared by the phenotypes. Concurrent symptoms also resulted from shared (25 %) and non-shared (31 %) environments. The factor loaded most on depression symptoms and least on somatic complaints. Trait-specific influences explained 44 % of depression variance, 59 % of anxiety variance, and 65 % of somatic variance. Our results suggest the presence of a general internalizing factor along which somatic complaints and mental distress can be modeled.

Adherence to medical treatment for Wilson's disease in children and adolescents: a cohort study from Turkey,"Göktas, MA; Yalcin, N","BackgroundThis study aimed to assess medication adherence and demographic, clinical, and psychopathological parameters such as quality of life, depression, and anxiety levels that can affect pediatrics with Wilson's Disease (WD). Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at an outpatient clinic in Turkey among pediatric patients (2 to 18 years) with WD between November 2022 and April 2023. The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) as a subjective and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) as an objective assessment were scored. Physical, genetic and biochemical parameters, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) for both parents and patients, Childhood Depression Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory were also administered. Results A total of 30 pediatric outpatients who were prescribed D-penicillamine (n = 27) or trientine (n = 3) as chelators and zinc (n = 29) and pyridoxine (n = 19) as supplements were included. Proteinuria (n = 3), skin rash (n = 2), and gastrointestinal upset (n = 2) were observed. When the correlation between MARS-5 and duration of follow-up was examined, a significant negative correlation was found (p = 0.014). According to MPRs, non-adherence rates (missed doses >= 20%) were 29.6%, 17.2% and 5.3% for D-penicillamine, zinc and pyridoxine, respectively. PedsQL scores were higher than those of parents, with a positive correlation between them (p < 0.001). Also, there was a significant positive correlation between PedsQL and State Anxiety Inventory (p < 0.001). Comparing the change in urinary copper levels between different levels of treatment knowledge, significant differences were observed between high- and low levels (p = 0.043). Conclusions Overall, nonadherence rates were 23.3% based on MARS-5 and 5.3-29.6% based on MPR.

Smoking and Schizophrenia in Population Cohorts of Swedish Women and Men: A Prospective Co-Relative Control Study,"Kendler, KS; Lönn, SL; Sundquist, J; Sundquist, K","Objective: The purpose of this study was to clarify the causes of the smoking-schizophrenia association.Method: Using Cox proportional hazard and co-relative control models, the authors predicted future risk for a diagnosis of schizophrenia or nonaffective psychosis from the smoking status of 1,413,849 women and 233,879 men from, respectively, the Swedish birth and conscript registries.Results: Smoking was assessed in women at a mean age of 27 and in men at a mean age of 18. The mean age at end of follow-up was 46 for women and 26 for men. Hazard ratios for first-onset schizophrenia were elevated both for light smoking (2.21[95% CI=1.90-2.56] for women and 2.15 [95% CI=1.25-3.44] for men) and heavy smoking (3.45 [95% CI=2.95-4.03] for women and 3.80 [95% CI=1.19-6.60] for men). These associations. did not decline when schizophrenia onsets 3-5 years after smoking assessment were censored. When age, socioeconomic status, and drug abuse were controlled for, hazard ratios declined only modestly in both samples. Women who smoked into late pregnancy had a much higher risk for schizophrenia than those who quit early. Hazard ratios predicting nonaffective psychosis in the general population, in cousins, in half siblings, and in full siblings discordant for heavy smoking were, respectively, 2.67, 2.71, 2.54, and 2.18. A model utilizing all relative pairs predicted a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95% CI=1.17-2.44) for nonaffective psychosis in the heavy-smoking member of discordant monozygotic twin pairs.Conclusions: Smoking prospectively predicts risk for schizophrenia. This association does not arise from smoking onset during a schizophrenic prodrome and demonstrates a clear dose-response relationship. While little of this association is explained by epidemiological confounders, a portion arises from common familial/genetic risk factors. However, in full siblings and especially monozygotic twins discordant for smoking, risk for nonaffective psychosis is appreciably higher in the smoking member.

What can time-frequency and phase coherence measures tell us about the genetic basis of P3 amplitude?,"Malone, SM; McGue, M; Iacono, WG","In a recent comprehensive investigation, we largely failed to identify significant genetic markers associated with P3 amplitude or to corroborate previous associations between P3 and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genes. In the present study we extended this line of investigation to examine time-frequency (TF) activity and intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) in the P3 time window, both of which are associated with P3 amplitude. Previous genome-wide research has reported associations between P3-related theta and delta activity and individual genetic variants. A large, population-based sample of 4211 subjects, comprising male and female adolescent twins and their parents, was genotyped for 527,828 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from which over six million SNPs were accurately imputed. Heritability estimates were greater for TF energy than ITPC, whether based on biometric models or the combined influence of all measured SNPs (derived from genome-wide complex trait analysis). The magnitude of overlap in the specific SNPs associated with delta energy and ITPC and P3 amplitude was significant. A genome-wide analysis of all SNPs, accompanied by an analysis of approximately 17,600 genes, indicated a region of chromosome 2 around TEKT4 that was significantly associated with theta ITPC. Analysis of candidate SNPs and genes previously reported to be associated with P3 or related phenotypes yielded one association surviving correction for multiple tests: between theta energy and CRHRI. However, we did not obtain significant associations for SNPs implicated in previous genome-wide studies of TF measures.

However, establishing whether these associations are causal is challenging when using observational designs. To evaluate the potential causal contributions of cannabis use, alcohol use, and tobacco smoking to suicide attempt, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomization, an instrumental variable approach using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables for three exposures: lifetime cannabis use (yes/no; 42 instrument SNPs; GWAS sample size [N] = 162,082), alcohol use (drinks-per-week; 53 instrument SNPs; N = 941,280), and tobacco smoking (initiation, yes/no; 156 instrument SNPs; N = 1,232,091; heaviness; 27 instrument SNPs; N = 337,334). The main outcome was suicide attempt measured from hospital records (N = 50,264).

The diagnosis of an SMI was extracted from the National Patient Register for all inpatient treatment episodes in Sweden from January 1, 1974, through December 31, 2011. Data were analyzed from May 3 to September 16, 2016.EXPOSURES Social maturity, mental energy, and emotional stability assessed at conscription interview.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inpatient diagnoses of bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and other nonaffective psychoses occurring until December 31, 2011.RESULTS Of the 1 017 691 men included in the cohort, 4310 developed bipolar disorder; 784, schizoaffective disorder; 4823, schizophrenia; and 5013, other nonaffective psychoses. After adjustment, with use of mean scores as a reference, low social maturity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.48-1.74), low mental energy (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-1.44), and low emotional stability (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.40-1.63) were inversely associated with schizophrenia in a dose-dependent fashion. Other nonaffective psychoses displayed a similar pattern. Bipolar disorder was associated with high (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35) and low (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25) social maturity and low emotional stability (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.46-1.78). Schizoaffective disorder was associated with low emotional stability (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.85).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Emotional stability is inversely associated with all SMI. Bipolar disorder has a unique U-shaped association with social maturity. Premorbid personality may reflect subtle changes in cerebral function, may combine with symptoms and other neurocognitive deficits to influence illness presentation, and/or may be owing to shared genetic architecture.",2017,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,74,7,703-711,WOS:000404969700010,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0583,,#4015,Hayes 2017,"",""
Familial co-aggregation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autoimmune diseases: a cohort study based on Swedish population-wide registers,"Hegvik, TA; Chen, Q; Kuja-Halkola, R; Klungsoyr, K; Butwicka, A; Lichtenstein, P; Almqvist, C; Faraone, S; Haavik, J; Larsson, H","Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with several autoimmune diseases (AD), both within individuals and across relatives, implying common underlying genetic or environmental factors in line with studies indicating that immunological mechanisms are key to brain development. To further elucidate the relationship between ADHD and autoimmunity we performed a population-wide familial co-aggregation study. Methods We linked Swedish national registries, defined a birth cohort with their biological relatives and identified individuals diagnosed with ADHD and/or 13 ADs. The cohort included 5 178 225 individuals born between 1960 and 2010, of whom 118 927 (2.30%) had been diagnosed with ADHD. We then investigated the associations between ADHD and ADs within individuals and across relatives, with logistic regression and structural equation modelling. Results Within individuals, ADHD was associated with a diagnosis of any of the 13 investigated ADs (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-1.38) as well as several specific ADs. Familial co-aggregation was observed. For example, ADHD was associated with any of the 13 ADs in mothers (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.26-1.32), fathers (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.11-1.18), full siblings (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.15-1.22), aunts (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.10-1.15), uncles (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05-1.10) and cousins (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.06). Still, the absolute risks of AD among those with ADHD were low. The genetic correlation between ADHD and a diagnosis of any of the investigated ADs was 0.13 (95% CI = 0.09-0.17) and the environmental correlation was 0.02 (95% CI = -0.03-0.06). Conclusions We found that ADHD and ADs co-aggregate among biological relatives, indicating that the relationship between ADHD and autoimmune diseases may in part be explained by shared genetic risk factors. The patterns of familial co-aggregation of ADHD and ADs do not readily support a role of maternal immune activation in the aetiology of ADHD. The findings have implications for aetiological models of ADHD. However, screening for autoimmunity among individuals with ADHD is not warranted.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,51,3,898-909,WOS:000756670100001,10.1093/ije/dyab151,,#4016,Hegvik 2022,"",""
Genetic and environmental influences on the relationship between adult ADHD symptoms and self-reported problem drinking in 6024 Dutch twins,"Derks, EM; Vink, JM; Willemsen, G; van den Brink, W; Boomsma, DI","Background. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown a positive association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and problematic alcohol use in adults. To what extent this association is explained by genetic and environmental factors is largely unknown.Method. Data on ADHD and alcohol consumption were collected by self-report in 6024 adult Dutch twins. ADHD symptoms were assessed by three subscales of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales - Self-Report:Screening Version (CAARS-S:SV):inattentiveness, hyperactivity and the ADHD index (ADHD-I). Problem drinking was defined as at least two self-reported alcohol-related problems on the CAGE questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was applied to the bivariate twin data to estimate genetic and environmental influences.Results. Heritability of ADHD symptoms ranged between 32% and 40% and heritability of problem drinking was 50%. The positive correlation between ADHD symptoms and problem drinking was confirmed in this general population sample, with phenotypic correlations between 0.20 and 0.28 and genetic correlations between 0.39 and 0.50. Phenotypic correlations are primarily (61-100%) explained by genetic influences with non-shared environmental influences explaining the remaining covariance. No significant quantitative or qualitative gender differences in covariance structure were found.Conclusions. This study convincingly shows that ADHD symptoms and problem drinking are moderately but significantly correlated in adults and that genetic correlations are primarily underlying this association. This suggests that early interventions are required to prevent adolescents with ADHD from developing problematic levels of alcohol use. Furthermore, clinicians who treat alcohol-dependent patients should be aware that the patient may have a co-morbid condition of ADHD; integrated interventions are required.",2014,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,44,12,2673-2683,WOS:000340403400020,10.1017/S0033291714000361,,#4017,Derks 2014,"",""
"Genotypes Do Not Confer Risk For Delinquency ut Rather Alter Susceptibility to Positive and Negative Environmental Factors: Gene-Environment Interactions of BDNF Val66Met, 5-HTTLPR, and MAOA-uVNTR","Nilsson, KW; Comasco, E; Hodgins, S; Oreland, L; Åslund, C","Background: Previous evidence of gene-by-environment interactions associated with emotional and behavioral disorders is contradictory. Differences in findings may result from variation in valence and dose of the environmental factor, and/or failure to take account of gene-by-gene interactions. The present study investigated interactions between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF Val66Met), the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA-uVNTR) polymorphisms, family conflict, sexual abuse, the quality of the child-parent relationship, and teenage delinquency.Methods: In 2006, as part of the Survey of Adolescent Life in Vastmanland, Sweden, 1 337 high-school students, aged 1718 years, anonymously completed questionnaires and provided saliva samples for DNA analyses.Results: Teenage delinquency was associated with two-, three-, and four-way interactions of each of the genotypes and the three environmental factors. Significant four-way interactions were found for BDNF Val66Met x 5-HTTLPRxMAOA-uVNTR x family conflicts and for BDNF Val66Met x 5-HTTLPRxMAOA-uVNTR x sexual abuse. Further, the two genotype combinations that differed the most in expression levels (BDNF Val66Met Val, 5-HTTLPR LL, MAOA-uVNTR LL [girls] and L [boys] vs BDNF Val66Met Val/Met, 5-HTTLPR S/LS, MAOA-uVNTR S/SS/LS) in interaction with family conflict and sexual abuse were associated with the highest delinquency scores. The genetic variants previously shown to confer vulnerability for delinquency (BDNF Val66Met Val/Met x 5-HTTLPR S x MAOA-uVNTR S) were associated with the lowest delinquency scores in interaction with a positive child-parent relationship.Conclusions: Functional variants of the MAOA-uVNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and BDNF Val66Met, either alone or in interaction with each other, may be best conceptualized as modifying sensitivity to environmental factors that confer either risk or protection for teenage delinquency.",2015,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,18,5,,WOS:000352538100016,10.1093/ijnp/pyu107,,#4019,Nilsson 2015,"",""
Genetic variation is associated with PTSD risk and aversive memory: Evidence from two trauma-Exposed African samples and one healthy European sample,"Wilker, S; Schneider, A; Conrad, D; Pfeiffer, A; Boeck, C; Lingenfelder, B; Freytag, V; Vukojevic, V; Vogler, C; Milnik, A; Papassotiropoulos, A; de Quervain, DJF; Elbert, T; Kolassa, S; Kolassa, IT","The probability to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by vivid, intrusive emotional memories of the encountered traumatic events, depends - among other factors - on the number of previous traumatic experiences (traumatic load) and individual genetic vulnerability. So far, our knowledge regarding the biological underpinnings of PTSD is relatively sparse. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) followed by independent replication might help to discover novel, so far unknown biological mechanisms associated with the development of traumatic memories. Here, a GWAS was conducted in N = 924 Northern Ugandan rebel war survivors and identified seven suggestively significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; p <= 1 x 10(-5)) for lifetime PTSD risk. Of these seven SNPs, the association of rs3852144 on chromosome 5 was replicated in an independent sample of Rwandan genocide survivors (N = 370, p < .01). While PTSD risk increased with accumulating traumatic experiences, the vulnerability was reduced in carriers of the minor G-allele in an additive manner. Correspondingly, memory for aversive pictures decreased with higher number of the minor G-allele in a sample of N = 2698 healthy Swiss individuals. Finally, investigations on N = 90 PTSD patients treated with Narrative Exposure Therapy indicated an additive effect of genotype on PTSD symptom change from pre-treatment to four months after treatment, but not between pretreatment and the 10-months follow-up. In conclusion, emotional memory formation seems to decline with increasing number of rs3852144 G-alleles, rendering individuals more resilient to PTSD development.

CIS-Acting Allele-Specific Expression Differences Induced by Alcohol and Impacted by Sex as Well as Parental Genotype of Origin,"Lo, CL; Lumeng, L; Bell, RL; Liang, T; Lossie, AC; Muir, WM; Zhou, FC","BackgroundAlcohol use disorders (AUDs) are influenced by complex interactions between the genetics of the individual and their environment. We have previously identified hundreds of polygenic genetic variants between the selectively bred high- and low-alcohol drinking (HAD and LAD) rat lines. Here, we report allele-specific expression (ASE) differences, between the HAD2 and LAD2 rat lines.MethodsThe HAD2 and LAD2 rats, which have been sequenced, were reciprocally crossed to generate 10 litters of F1 progeny. For 5 of these litters, the sire was HAD2, and for the other 5 litters, the sire was a LAD2. From these 10 litters, 2 males and 2 females were picked from each F1 litter (N=40 total). The F1 pups were divided, balancing for sex and direction of cross, into an alcohol (15%) versus a water control group. Alcohol drinking started in the middle of adolescence (similar to postnatal day 35) and lasted 9weeks. At the end of these treatments, rats were euthanized, the nucleus accumbens was dissected, and RNA was processed for RNA-sequencing and ASE analyses.ResultsAnalyses revealed that adolescent ethanol (EtOH) drinking, individual EtOH drinking levels, parentage, and sex-of-animal affected ASEs of about 300genes. The identified genes included those associated with EtOH metabolism (e.g., Aldh2); neuromodulatory function (e.g., Cckbr, Slc6a7, and Slc1a1); ion channel activity (e.g., Kcnc3); and other synaptic and epigenetic functions.ConclusionsThese data indicate that EtOH drinking differentially amplified paternal versus maternal allelic contribution to the transcriptome. We hypothesize that this was due, at least in part, to EtOH-induced changes in cis-regulation of polymorphisms previously identified between the HAD2 and LAD2 rat lines.

However, the genetic basis of automatic thoughts remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the genetic association of automatic thoughts with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) involved in cognition, neurogenesis, neuronal cell structure, neurotransmitters, hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal axis and psychiatric illness. The study included 610 healthy participants. We used the Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS), a Japanese psychological questionnaire, to assess automatic thoughts. Twenty-five SNPs including COMT, BDNF, FKBP5, SNTB1 (syntrophin-beta 1, rs4512418), and MCPH1 (microcephalin 1, rs2911968) were selected according to their minor allele frequency. Linear regression models were used to test association of mean DACS scores with each allele (major-allele homozygote, heterozygote, and minor-allele homozygote). The significant a-value was set at alpha < 0.002. Statistical analysis was conducted using SNPStats. Call rates for all genotypes were > 98%. Eighteen SNPs did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and 7 were excluded from statistical analysis. Significant associations of SNTB1 with interpersonal threat and MCPH1 with future denial were observed only in females. SNTB1 and MCPH1 are located on chromosome 8, which may be involved in neuroticism, avoidant personality and depression. Our results demonstrated that DACS scores showing significant interaction with the 2 SNPs may be regarded as appropriate traits to detect the diathesis of automatic thoughts.

This paper aims to compare the prevalence of allele and genotype frequencies created by the 3' UTR variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of this gene between crack cocaine users and controls. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 237 current adult crack cocaine abusers or dependents (DSM-IV TR criteria) from in- and outpatient clinics in southern Brazil and 205 community controls were compared. The subjects were evaluated using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview short version, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. DNA samples were genotyped for the DAT1 3' VNTR. Results: Logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the frequency of the 10.10 genotype (the putative risk genotype) to those of other genotypes.

Our analysis explores both the effect of ADHD on educational outcomes and the reverse, i.e., the influence of educational attainment on ADHD risk.Method A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was conducted using genetic instruments from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European populations. We employed a two-step MR approach to assess the causal effects between ADHD, mobile phone screen time (both frequency and duration), and educational outcomes, including years of full-time education and college completion. Data from public genome-wide association studies encompassing European populations with sample sizes ranging from 55,374 to 470,941 were utilised.Results We found significant causal associations between childhood ADHD and educational attainment, partially mediated by mobile phone screen time. Childhood ADHD was negatively linked to years of full-time education (IVW: OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90-0.97, p = 0.000) and college completion (IVW: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.98, p = 0.000). Mobile phone use frequency mediated 19.3% of the effect on full-time education (beta = -0.158) and 11.9% on college completion (beta = -0.084). The duration of phone use mediated 64.8% of the effect on college completion (beta = -0.054). When ADHD was the outcome, phone use duration mediated -22.45% of full-time education effects (beta = 0.426) and -19.62% of college completion (beta = 0.433).Conclusion Different MR models reveal the complex mediation role of mobile phone use frequency and duration between ADHD and educational attainment, varying by educational outcome type. Frequency mediates the link between childhood ADHD and full-time education/college completion, while duration significantly impacts ADHD when higher education is the outcome. The notable mediation effect of duration on ADHD underscores the need for further study into screen time's influence on ADHD and academic achievement across stages.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,15,,,WOS:001379209500001,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1424082,,#4040,Lin 2024,"",""

Participants were recruited through the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network. Participants with stable health and fluency in English underwent genotypic and phenotypic characterization from November 5, 2009, through December 30. 2011. Data were analyzed from January 1 through July 30, 2021.EXPOSURES The study examined (1) CNV risk scores derived from models of burden, predicted intolerance, and gene dosage sensitivity; (2) PGSs from genomewide association studies related to developmental outcomes; and (3) environmental factors, including trauma exposure and neighborhood socioeconomic status.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The study examined (1) neurocognition, with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery; (2) psychopathology, with structured interviews based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children; and (3) brain volume, with magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS Participants included 9498 youths aged 8 to 21 years; 4906 (51.7%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 14.2 (3.7) years. After quality control, 18 185 total CNVs greater than 50 kilobases (10 517 deletions and 7668 duplications) were identified in 7101 unrelated participants genotyped on Illumina arrays. In these participants, elevated CNV risk scores were associated with lower overall accuracy on cognitive tests (standardized beta = 0.12; 95% s CI, 0.10-0.14; P = 7.41 x 10(-26)) ; lower accuracy across a range of cognitive subdomains; increased overall psychopathology; increased psychosis-spectrum symptoms; and higher deviation from a normative developmental model of brain volume. Statistical models of developmental outcomes were significantly improved when CNV risk scores were combined with PGSs and environmental factors.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, elevated CNV risk scores were associated with lower cognitive ability, higher psychopathology including psychosis-spectrum symptoms, and greater deviations from normative magnetic resonance imaging models of brain development.

MethodsData were drawn from three cohorts of participants (N = 1,103; 45% male) who were recruited in first grade as part of a series of elementary school-based, universal preventive intervention trials conducted in a Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. In young adulthood, participants provided a DNA sample and reported on whether they had used heroin or misused prescription opioids in their lifetime. Three substance use PRS were computed based on prior GWAS: lifetime cannabis use from Pasman et al. (2018), heavy drinking indexed via maximum number of drinks from Gelernter et al. (2019), and alcohol consumption from Kranzler et al. (2019). ResultsHigher PRS for lifetime cannabis use, greater heavy drinking, and greater alcohol consumption were associated with heightened risk for misusing opioids among the whole sample. Significant sex by PRS interactions were also observed such that higher PRS for heavy drinking and alcohol consumption were associated with a greater likelihood of opioid misuse among males, but not females.

Anorexia runs in families: is this due to genes or the family environment?,"Dring, G","Anorexia runs in families. This, together with the high level of concordance between identical twins, has led many authorities in the field to argue that genetic factors pay a substantial part in its aetiology. The decoding of the human genome has made possible research on the genetics of anorexia. This has failed to confirm the expected relationship. A number of leaders in the field of family therapy advocate the idea that family relationships do not cause anorexia. However, the failure of genetic explanations draws attention back to the possible role of family factors. These include family attitudes to eating and weight, attachment difficulties, problems with the expression and resolution of conflict and parental psychological control. This article briefly summarizes the current state of the genetic findings and highlights some areas of research on the family, eating disorders and anorexia that are of relevance to the practice of family therapy.Practitioner points Family therapists need not allow theories about the genetic origins of anorexia to distract them from their customary curiosity about family processes.

Mendelian randomization found no causal relationship between omega-6 fatty acids and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Saeed, S; Jiang, LY; Xu, JJ; Wang, GH; Leng, MW; Wu, J; Qian, SY; Jiang, CM","Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually known as a hyperkinetic syndrome. It is also one of the primary reasons for academic struggle in children, and the most prevalent behavioral disorder especially in young people. Arachidonic acid (ARA), which is found in high concentrations in the brain, is formed in large part from gamma-linolenic acid (GLE). Mendelian randomization (MR) is an advanced method for overcoming the drawbacks of observational studies and using human genetics to guide prevention strategies for ADHD. This study aims to examine the therapeutic effect between omega-6 fatty acids and ADHD by means of a two-sample MR design. Methods: To investigate evidence of a therapeutic effect between omega-6 fatty acids and the onset of ADHD. A two-sample MR method was used to assess data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to omega-6 fatty acids that were downloaded from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) database. The instrument variables (IVs) were the SNPs. The findings were validated using data from the ADHD GWAS, which included 20,138 cases and 35,191 controls. The sample population was European, and the sample size was 13,506. A clumping procedure was performed to retain the SNPs that were related to omega-6 fatty acids at a genome-wide significance level of P<5x10(-8). SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with the index SNPs (r(2) threshold <= 0.001) or within a 10,000 kb distance. Results: According to the inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis, the odd ratio of the 5-SNP IVs was 0.94 per Standard deviation of omega-6 fatty acids, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.81-1.03 and a P value of 0.17. Analyses using the weighted median mode, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode revealed comparable findings. Conclusions: Despite observational studies repeatedly reporting an association between reduced omega-6 fatty acids and the onset of ADHD, MR analyses in our study find no evidence of a therapeutic effect between omega-6 fatty acids and the onset of ADHD. Hence this suggests that excess omega-6 fatty acids may be a risk factor for ADHD.",2023,,AME MEDICAL JOURNAL,8,,,WOS:001208069000007,10.21037/amj-22-74,,#4061,Saeed 2023,"",""

Risk of Suicidal Behaviors and Antidepressant Exposure Among Children and Adolescents: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies,"Li, K; Zhou, GB; Xiao, Y; Gu, JY; Chen, QL; Xie, SX; Wu, JY","Objectives: Although several studies have reviewed the suicidal risk of antidepressants, the conclusions remain inconsistent. We, therefore, performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to address the association between exposure to antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of suicide and suicide attempt in children and adolescents. Methods: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from January 1990 to April 2021. Seventeen cohort and case-control studies were identified that reported suicide or suicide attempt in children and young adults (aged 5-25 years) who were exposed to any antidepressants. We extracted the estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each publication. Results: The results showed that antidepressant exposure significantly increased the risk of suicide and suicide attempt when compared with no antidepressant usage among children and adolescents. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.16-1.64; I-2 = 83.1%). Among the antidepressants, SSRI use was associated with an increased risk of suicide and suicide attempt, and the pooled RR was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.09-1.51; I-2 = 68.8%). In subgroup analysis, the attempted suicidal risk of antidepressant and SSRI was significantly increased (RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.61; I-2 = 86.2% for all antidepressants; and RR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06-1.48; I-2 = 73.8% for SSRIs), while the completed suicidal risk of antidepressant and SSRI was not statistically significant (RR = 2.32, 95% CI: 0.82-6.53; I-2 = 6.28% for all antidepressants; and RR = 1.88, 95% CI: 0.74-4.79; I-2 = 52.0% for SSRIs). In addition, the risk of suicide and suicide attempt between SSRIs and other antidepressants was similar (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87-1.46, I-2 = 32.4%). Conclusion: The main findings of this meta-analysis provide some evidence that antidepressant exposure seems to have an increased suicidal risk among children and young adults. Since untreated depression remains one of the largest risk factors for suicide and the efficacy of antidepressants is proven, clinicians should evaluate carefully their patients and be cautious with patients at risk to have treatment emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation (TESI/TWOSI) when prescribing antidepressants to children and young patients.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,13,,,WOS:000808291800001,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.880496,,#4066,Li 2022,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
Genetic Contributions to Loneliness and Their Relevance to the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness,"Spithoven, AWM; Cacioppo, S; Goossens, L; Cacioppo, JT","Loneliness is a negative and distressing emotional state that arises from a discrepancy between one's desired and achieved levels of social connectedness. The evolutionary theory of loneliness (ETL) posits that experiencing loneliness is an inherited adaptation that signals that salutary social relations are endangered or damaged and prompts people to reconnect to significant others. The basic tenets of the ETL has led researchers to examine the genetic underpinnings of loneliness. The current review provides an updated overview of genetic studies on loneliness and discusses the importance of genetic research for the ETL. The most recent studies suggest that the many genes that contribute to a small degree to differences in loneliness partially overlap with genes that contribute to neuroticism, but not with depression. In addition, the genetic studies discussed in this review show that genes are unlikely to have a direct effect on loneliness. Instead, environmental factors determine in a dynamic fashion how genes that contribute to loneliness are expressed. Future research on epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, can further elucidate the dynamic interplay between genes and the environment and how this interplay contributes to loneliness.",2019,,PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,14,3,376-396,WOS:000468290800005,10.1177/1745691618812684,,#4072,Spithoven 2019,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the effect of acne on the risk of six common mental disorders, i.e., depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We acquired genetic instruments for assessing acne from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of acne (N = 615,396) and collected summary statistics from the largest available GWAS for depression (N = 500,199), anxiety (N = 17,310), schizophrenia (N = 130,644), OCD (N = 9,725), bipolar disorder (N = 413,466), and PTSD (N = 174,659). Next, we performed the two-sample MR analysis using four methods: inverse-variance weighted method, MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outliers. Sensitivity analysis was also performed for heterogeneity and pleiotropy tests. ResultsThere was no evidence of a causal impact of acne on the risk of depression [odds ratio (OR): 1.002, p = 0.874], anxiety (OR: 0.961, p = 0.49), OCD (OR: 0.979, p = 0.741), bipolar disorder (OR: 0.972, p = 0.261), and PTSD (OR: 1.054, p = 0.069). Moreover, a mild protective effect of acne against schizophrenia was observed (OR: 0.944; p = 0.033).

Genetics of Addiction: Future Focus on Gene x Environment Interaction?,"Vink, JM","The heritability of substance use is moderate to high. Successful efforts to find genetic variants associated with substance use (smoking, alcohol, cannabis) have been undertaken by large consortia. However, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the identified genetic variants is small. Interestingly, there is overlap between the genetic variants that influence different substances. Moreover, there are sets of ""substance-specific"" genes and sets of genes contributing to a ""vulnerability for addictive behavior"" in general. It is important to recognize that genes alone do not determine addiction phenotypes: Environmental factors such as parental monitoring, peer pressure, or socioeconomic status also play an important role. Despite a rich epidemiologic literature focused on the social determinants of substance use, few studies have examined the moderation of genetic influences like gene-environment (G x E) interactions. Understanding this balance may hold the key to understanding the individual differences in substance use, abuse, and addictive behavior. Recommendations for future research are described in this commentary and include increasing the power of G x E studies by using state-of-the-art methods such as polygenic risk scores instead of single genetic variants and taking genetic overlap between substances into account. Future genetic studies should also investigate environmental risk factors for addictive behavior more extensively to unravel the interaction between nature and nurture. Focusing on G x E interactions not only will give insight into the underlying biological mechanism but will also characterize subgroups (based on environmental factors) at high risk for addictive behaviors.

Gene-environment interplay in externalizing behavior from childhood through adulthood,"Kretschmer, T; Vrijen, C; Nolte, IM; Wertz, J; Hartman, CA","Background Genetic and environmental influences on externalizing problems are often studied separately. Here, we extended prior work by investigating the implications of gene-environment interplay in childhood for early adult externalizing behavior. Genetic nurture would be indicated if parents' genetic predisposition for externalizing behavior operates through the family environment in predicting offspring early adult externalizing behavior. Evocative gene-environment correlation would be indicated if offspring genetic predisposition for externalizing behavior operates through child externalizing behavior in affecting the family environment and later early adult externalizing behavior. Method Longitudinal data from seven waves of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a prospective cohort study of Dutch adolescents followed from age 11 to age 29 (n at baseline = 2,734) were used. Child externalizing behavior was assessed using self and parent reports. Family dysfunction was assessed by parents. Early adult externalizing behavior was assessed using self-reports. Genome-wide polygenic scores for externalizing problems were constructed for mothers, fathers, and offspring. Results Offspring polygenic score and child behavior each predicted early adult externalizing problems, as did family dysfunction to a small extent. Parents' polygenic scores were not associated with offspring's early adult externalizing behavior. Indirect effect tests indicated that offspring polygenic score was associated with greater family dysfunction via child externalizing behavior (evocative gene-environment correlation) but the effect was just significant and the effect size was very small. Parents' polygenic scores did not predict family dysfunction, thus the data do not provide support for genetic nurture.

Methods Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we examined the data of 2677 probands with fibromyalgia, 2780 unaffected siblings, and 11,120 matched controls to assess the risk of migraine. In contrast, 1830 probands with migraine, 1936 unaffected siblings, and 7744 matched controls to assess the risk of fibromyalgia.

Novel approaches to alcohol rehabilitation: Modification of stress-responsive brain regions through environmental enrichment,"Pang, TY; Hannan, AJ; Lawrence, AJ","Relapse remains the most prominent hurdle to successful rehabilitation from alcoholism. The neural mechanisms underlying relapse are complex, but our understanding of the brain regions involved, the anatomical circuitry and the modulation of specific nuclei in the context of stress and cue-induced relapse have improved significantly in recent years. In particular, stress is now recognised as a significant trigger for relapse, adding to the well-established impact of chronic stress to escalate alcohol consumption. It is therefore unsurprising that the stress-responsive regions of the brain have also been implicated in alcohol relapse, such as the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and the hypothalamus. Environmental enrichment is a robust experimental paradigm which provides a non-pharmacological tool to alter stress response and, separately, alcohol-seeking behaviour and symptoms of withdrawal. In this review, we examine and consolidate the preclinical evidence that alcohol seeking behaviour and stress induced relapse are modulated by environmental enrichment, and these are primarily mediated by modification of neural activity within the key nodes of the addiction circuitry. Finally, we discuss the limited clinical evidence that stress-reducing approaches such as mindfulness could potentially serve as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of alcoholism.This article is part of the Special Issue entitled ""Neurobiology of Environmental Enrichment"".

Preliminary evidence for a role of the adrenergic nervous system in generalized anxiety disorder,"Zhang, XB; Norton, J; Carrière, I; Ritchie, K; Chaudieu, I; Ryan, J; Ancelin, ML","Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic condition that is understudied compared to other psychiatric disorders. An altered adrenergic function has been reported in GAD, however direct evidence for genetic susceptibility is missing. This study evaluated the associations of gene variants in adrenergic receptors (ADRs) with GAD, with the involvement of stressful events. Data were obtained from 844 French community-dwelling elderly aged 65 or over. Anxiety disorders were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatry Interview, according to DSM-IV criteria. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved with adrenergic function were genotyped; adrenergic receptors alpha(1A) (ADRA1A), alpha(2A) (ADRA2A), and beta2 (ADRB2) and transcription factor TCF7L2. Questionnaires evaluated recent stressful life events as well as early environment during childhood and adolescence. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses four SNPs were significantly associated with GAD. A 4-fold modified risk was found with ADRA1A rs17426222 and rs573514, and ADRB2 rs1042713 which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Certain variants may moderate the effect of adverse life events on the risk of GAD. Replication in larger samples is needed due to the small case number. This is the first study showing that ADR variants are susceptibility factors for GAD, further highlighting the critical role of the adrenergic nervous system in this disorder.",2017,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,7,,,WOS:000394254600001,10.1038/srep42676,,#4104,Zhang 2017,"",""
Investigating the shared genetic architecture between attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and risk taking behavior: A large-scale genomewide cross-trait analysis,"Chen, YJ; Liu, P; Yi, SJ; Fan, CH; Zhao, W; Liu, J","Background: This study aims to explore the genetic architecture shared between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and risk behavior.

Then, we conducted cross-trait analysis to identified the Pleiotropic loci. Finally, bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) was applied to examine the causal relationship. Results: We found a significant positive genetic correlation between ADHD and risk-taking behavior (rg = 0.351, p = 6.50E-37). The cross-trait meta-analysis identified 27 significant SNPs shared between ADHD and risk behavior. The most significant locus, located near the CADM2 gene on chromosome 3, had been identified associated with this two trait (pADHD = 3.07E-05 and prisk-taking behavior = 2.47E-30).

The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were applied to assess environmental factors. Venous blood was drawn from the twins for zygosity determination. Structural equation modeling was performed to evaluate the effects of additive genetic factors (A), common environmental factors (C), and individual-specific environmental factors (E) on adolescent anxiety. The estimates of A and E on adolescent anxiety were 0.34 (95% CI = 0.12-0.53) and 0.66 (95% CI:0.47-0.89), respectively. The environment played an important role in adolescent anxiety. Adolescent anxiety was significantly positively correlated with peer relations (r = 0.606, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with prosocial behavior (r = 0.207, p < 0. 05).

DNA methylation as a possible mechanism linking childhood adversity and health: results from a 2-sample mendelian randomization study,"Schuurmans, IK; Dunn, EC; Lussier, AA","Childhood adversity is an important risk factor for adverse health across the life course. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), are a hypothesized mechanism linking adversity to disease susceptibility. Yet, few studies have determined whether adversity-related DNAm alterations are causally related to future health outcomes or if their developmental timing plays a role in these relationships. Here, we used 2-sample mendelian randomization to obtain stronger causal inferences about the association between adversity-associated DNAm loci across development (ie, birth, childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood) and 24 mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes. We identified particularly strong associations between adversity-associated DNAm and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicide attempts, asthma, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. More of these associations were identified for birth and childhood DNAm, whereas adolescent and young adulthood DNAm were more closely linked to mental health. Childhood DNAm loci also had primarily risk-suppressing relationships with health outcomes, suggesting that DNAm might reflect compensatory or buffering mechanisms against childhood adversity rather than acting solely as an indicator of disease risk. Together, our results suggest adversity-related DNAm alterations are linked to both physical and mental health outcomes, with particularly strong impacts of DNAm differences emerging earlier in development.",2024,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,193,11,1541-1552,WOS:001314667200001,10.1093/aje/kwae072,,#4114,Schuurmans 2024,"",""

Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Memantine for Children and Adults With ADHD With a Focus on Glutamate-Dopamine Regulation: A Systematic Review,"Choi, WS; Wang, SM; Woo, YS; Bahk, WM","Objective: Pharmacotherapy plays a crucial role in treating attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADH D). However, current medications for ADHD have limitations and potential adverse effects. Glutamate, a neurotransmitter that directly and indirectly modulates dopamine neurotransmission, is considered a new therapeutic target for ADHD. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of memantine, an uncompetitive N-methylD-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, in both pediatric and adult patients with ADHD. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for articles on memantine use in ADHD patients published up to August 31, 2023, using terms related to ADHD and memantine. Study Selection: Studies selected according to PRISMA guidelines. We included both randomized and nonrandomized trials for a comprehensive review. We excluded non-English publications, review articles, and studies without full text. Data Extraction: Two authors extracted data using the data extraction form designed for this review. Independent authors conducted a risk of bias assessment using risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, 3 on pediatric populations, and 3 on adults. Three studies were conducted in the United States (2 in adults) and 3 in Iran (1 in adults). Memantine showed potential benefits in managing ADHD symptoms and had a favorable safety profile.

A review on menstrual health in adolescent girls emphasizing multi-omics and machine learning strategies for preventing reproductive tract infections,"Ganguly, M; Ganguly, A; Chattaraj, S; Midya, DK","Adolescence is a period characterized by significant physical and psychological hurdles for young females. The onset of menstruation signifies a crucial transition from childhood to womanhood, instigating various physical changes and emotional responses that profoundly impact adolescents' experiences and overall well-being. During this period, reproductive tract infections (RTIs) emerge as a significant health concern, potentially leading to severe physical and psychological consequences, including reproductive health complications and diminished quality of life. This review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between menstruation and adolescent health by examining the onset of menstruation, its associated physical and psychological changes, and the critical importance of effective menstrual hygiene management. Additionally, the societal implications of menstruation, such as stigma and access to resources, are explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by adolescent girls. To address the serious issue of RTIs, we propose an innovative framework that integrates multi-omics approaches encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics with machine learning techniques. This integration aims to facilitate predictive modeling and enhance symptom tracking, thereby promoting menstrual health literacy and informed decision-making.

The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease at 25years,"Selkoe, DJ; Hardy, J","Despite continuing debate about the amyloid -protein (or A hypothesis, new lines of evidence from laboratories and clinics worldwide support the concept that an imbalance between production and clearance of A42 and related A peptides is a very early, often initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of -secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates A. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to A deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD. Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in >40% of cases, has been found to impair A clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of A42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A42 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years.

Method: This study performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to confirm the causality between screen time and childhood ADHD. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets derived from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and the UK Biobank were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with exposure and outcome. Four categories of datasets were selected to represent screen time. The SNPs that are significantly associated with exposure data (P < 5e-08) and have a strong correlation with the exposure in the F-statistic (F > 10) were selected as instrumental variables. This study also used the PhenoScanner V2 database and the LDlink webtool to exclude confounding factors, and the MR-PRESSO method (p < 0.05) was employed to eliminate outliers with bias.

Genetic influences on depression and selection into adverse life experiences,"Rauf, T; Freese, J","Genome-wide association studies find that a large number of genetic variants jointly influence the risk of depression, which is summarized by polygenic indices (PGIs) of depressive symptoms and major depression. But PGIs by design remain agnostic about the causal mechanisms linking genes to depression. Meanwhile, the role of adverse life experiences in shaping depression risk is well-documented, including via gene-environment correlation. Building on theoretical work on dynamic and contingent genetic selection, we suggest that genetic influences may lead to differential selection into negative life experiences, forging gene-environment correlations that manifest in various permutations of depressive behaviors and environmental adversities. We also examine the extent to which apparent genetic influences may reflect spurious associations due to factors such as indirect genetic effects. Using data from two large surveys of middle-aged and older US adults, we investigate to what extent a PGI of depression predicts the risk of 27 different adversities. Further, to glean insights about the kinds of processes that might lead to gene-environment correlation, we augment these analyses with data from an original preregistered survey to measure cultural understandings of the behavioral dependence of various adversities. We find that the PGI predicts the risk of majority of adversities, net of class background and prior depression, and that the selection risk is greater for adversities typically perceived as being dependent on peoples' own behaviors. Taken together, our findings suggest that the PGI of depression largely picks up the risk of behaviorally-influenced adversities, but to a lesser degree also captures other environmental influences. The results invite further exploration into the behavioral and interactional processes that lie along the pathways intervening between genetic differences and wellbeing.",2024,,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,344,,,WOS:001292403500001,10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.116633,,#4133,Rauf 2024,"",""
New Research Perspectives on the Interplay Between Genes and Environment on Executive Function Development,"Miguel, PM; Meaney, MJ; Silveira, PP","Executive functions (EFs) are a set of skills responsible for the cognitive control of emotional states and behavior as well as for information processing required for learning and memory.

EF development shows a protracted course that begins in early childhood and continues throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. Maturation of EFs is subject to environmental influences such that adversity during development can affect multiple EF-mediated processes and outcomes. In this review, we describe sensitive periods for the development of EFs and the effects of adverse environmental exposures, with consideration of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.

There is emerging evidence that dietary patterns and specific nutritional components might play a role in the risk for developing depression.This study protocol focusses on the role of vitamin D which is for long known to be relevant for calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and bone health but might also impact on mental health. However, the assessment of the vitamin D status of depressed juvenile patients, or supplementation of vitamin D is currently not part of routine treatment. Controlled intervention studies are indispensable to prove whether a vitamin D deficiency ameliorates depressive symptoms.Methods/design: This double blinded, randomized controlled trial will enroll 200 inpatients from a child and adolescent psychiatric department with a vitamin D deficiency defined by a 25(OH)-vitamin D-level <30 nmol/l (12 ng/ml) and a Beck Depressions Inventory (BDI-II) score > 13 (indicating at least: mild depression). Upon referral, all patients will be screened, checked for inclusion criteria, and those eligible will be randomized after written consent into a supplementation or placebo group. Both study-arms will receive treatment-as-usual for their psychiatric disorder according to established clinical guidelines. The participants of the vitamin D supplementation group will receive 2640 I.E. vitamin D3 q.d. for 28 days in accordance with best practice in pediatric endocrinology. We hypothesize that delaying supplementation of vitamin D in the placebo arm will affect the treatment success of the depressive symptomatology in comparison to the vitamin D supplementation group. Patients will be enrolled for a period of 28 days based on the mean length of hospitalization of juveniles with depression.Discussion: Randomized controlled trials in children and adolescents with depression are needed to elucidate the role of a vitamin D deficiency for mental disorders and to investigate the relevance of a routine assessment and supplementation of vitamin D deficits.",2018,,BMC PSYCHIATRY,18,,,WOS:000426372600001,10.1186/s12888-018-1637-7,,#4137,Föcker 2018,"",""
Prevalence of comorbidity and associated risk factors in adults with atopic dermatitis,"Egeberg, A; Andersen, YMF; Gislason, GH; Skov, L; Thyssen, JP","BackgroundAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disorder, which may persist into adulthood; however, the prevalence of comorbidities in patients with AD is not well characterized. AD is considered a systemic disorder like psoriasis, which has raised a need for data on the comorbidity profile of patients with AD, to assess the potential risks, benefits, and complications in management of patients with AD. We described the occurrence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities and associated risk factors in adults with AD compared with psoriasis and the general population.MethodsAll Danish individuals aged 18 years with a hospital (inpatient or ambulatory) diagnosis of AD or psoriasis during the study period (January 1, 1995-December 31, 2012) were linked in administrative registers.ResultsOverall, prevalence of smoking and alcohol abuse was higher among patients with AD than the general population, but lower than psoriasis patients. Similarly, patients with AD had more risk factors and higher prevalence of comorbidity than the general population, but lower prevalence and reduced risk compared to psoriasis patients, except for use of anxiolytics, which was higher in severe AD. Prevalence of diabetes was lower in AD than psoriasis patients as well as general population controls.ConclusionsDespite an increased risk of various medical and psychiatric comorbidities compared to general population controls, adult patients with AD had markedly lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease than psoriasis patients.

Functional effects of dopamine transporter gene genotypes on in vivo dopamine transporter functioning: a meta-analysis,"Faraone, SV; Spencer, TJ; Madras, BK; Zhang-James, Y; Biederman, J","Much psychiatric genetic research has focused on a 40-base pair variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism located in the 30-untranslated region (30UTR) of the dopamine active transporter (DAT) gene (SLC6A3). This variant produces two common alleles with 9- and 10-repeats (9R and 10R). Studies associating this variant with in vivo DAT activity in humans have had mixed results. We searched for studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate this association. Random effects meta-analyses assessed the association of the 30UTR variant with DAT activity. We also evaluated heterogeneity among studies and evidence for publication bias. We found twelve studies comprising 511 subjects, 125 from PET studies and 386 from SPECT studies. The PET studies provided highly significant evidence that the 9R allele was associated with increased DAT activity in human adults. The SPECT studies were highly heterogeneous. As a group, they suggested no association between the 30UTR polymorphism and DAT activity. When the analysis was limited to the most commonly used ligand, [123I] b-CIT, stratification by affection status dramatically reduced heterogeneity and revealed a significant association of the 9R allele with increased DAT activity for healthy subjects. In humans, the 9R allele of the 30UTR polymorphism of SLC6A3 regulates dopamine activity in the striatal brain regions independent of the presence of neuropsychiatric illness. Differences in study methodology account for the heterogeneous results across individual studies.",2014,,MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY,19,8,880-889,WOS:000340040200008,10.1038/mp.2013.126,,#4140,Faraone 2014,"",""
Premorbid Personality Traits as Risk Factors for Behavioral Addictions: A Systematic Review of a Vulnerability Hypothesis,"Smirni, D; Smirni, P; Lavanco, G; Caci, B","The debate on personality structure and behavioral addictions is an outstanding issue. According to some authors, behavioral addictions could arise from a premorbid personality, while for others, it could result from a pathological use of technological tools. The current study aims to investigate whether, in the latest literature, personality traits have been identified as predictors of behavioral addictions. A literature search was conducted under the PRISMA methodology, considering the most relevant studies of the five-factor model from the past 10 years. Overall, most studies on addiction, personality traits, and personality genetics proved that behavioral addiction may be an epiphenomenon of a pre-existing personality structure, and that it more easily occurs in vulnerable subjects with emotional instability, negative affects, and unsatisfactory relationships with themselves, others, and events. Such neurotic personality structure was common to any addictive behavior, and was the main risk factor for both substance and behavioral addictions. Therefore, in clinical and educational contexts, it becomes crucial to primarily focus on the vulnerability factors, at-risk personality traits, and protective and moderating traits such as extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience; meanwhile, treatment of behavioral addictions is frequently focused on overt pathological behaviors.",2023,,CHILDREN-BASEL,10,3,,WOS:000955740400001,10.3390/children10030467,,#4141,Smirni 2023,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
Do Sleep Disturbances and Psychotic-Like Experiences in Adolescence Share Genetic and Environmental Influences?,"Taylor, MJ; Gregory, AM; Freeman, D; Ronald, A","Sleep disturbances regularly co-occur with clinical psychotic disorders and dimensions of psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). One possible explanation for this, which has yet to be tested, is that similar genetic or environmental influences underlie sleep disturbances and vulnerability to PLEs. We conducted a twin study to test this possibility in relation to sleep disturbances and six specific PLEs in adolescence in the general population. Approximately 5,000 16-year-old twin pairs completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index. PLEs were assessed using the Specific PLEs Questionnaire, comprising five self-report subscales (Paranoia, Hallucinations, Cognitive Disorganization, Grandiosity, and Anhedonia) and one parent-report subscale (Negative Symptoms). The associations between these measures were tested using structural equation twin model fitting. Paranoia, Hallucinations, and Cognitive Disorganization displayed moderate and significant correlations with both sleep measures (0.32-.42), while Negative Symptoms, Anhedonia, and Grandiosity showed lower correlations (0.01-0.17). Genetic and environmental influences significantly overlapped across PLEs (Paranoia, Hallucinations, Cognitive Disorganization) and both types of sleep disturbance (mean genetic and nonshared environmental correlations = 0.54 and 0.24, respectively). These estimates reduced, yet remained significant, after controlling for negative affect. The association between PLEs with sleep disturbances in adolescence is partly due to genetic and environmental influences that are common to them both. These findings indicate that the known neurobiology of sleep disturbance may provide clues regarding the causes of PLEs in adolescence.",2015,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,124,3,674-684,WOS:000359379000018,10.1037/abn0000057,,#4142,Taylor 2015,"",""
Hypomania spectrum disorders from adolescence to adulthood: A 15-year follow-up of a community sample,"Päären, N; von Knorring, AL; Olsson, G; von Knorring, L; Bohman, H; Jonsson, U","Background: There is a lack of scientific knowledge about the broader spectrum of hypomania in adolescence and the course over time. To investigate this, we used longitudinal data spanning from adolescence to age 31 years.Method: A community sample of adolescents (N=2300) was screened for depressive symptoms. Adolescents (16-17 years) with a positive screening and matched controls were interviewed with a structured diagnostic interview. A blinded follow-up assessment was conducted 15 years later, with a structured diagnostic interview covering the age span 19-31 years. Questions about treatment and family history were included.Results: Ninety adolescents (16-17 years) with a lifetime hypomania spectrum episode (3.9% of the total sample) were identified: 40 with fullsyndromal, 18 with brief-episode (<4 day), and 32 with subsyndromal (1-2 main symptoms and 1-2 additional symptoms) hypomania. The hypomania symptoms reported by the fullsyndromal and the brief-episode groups were similar, whereas the subsyndromal group per definition reported fewer symptoms. Of the 90 adolescents with a hypomania spectrum episode, 64 (71%) participated in the follow-up interview. Mania in adulthood was reported by 2 (3%), hypomania by an additional 4 (6%), and major depression by 38 (59%). Incidence of mood episodes in adulthood did not differ between the subgroups of hypomania spectrum.Limitations: 29% of the participants with hypomania spectrum were lost to follow-up.Conclusion: The results indicate that only a small proportion of adolescents with hypomania spectrum episodes continue to have (hypo)mania in adulthood. Thus, maintenance or prophylactic treatment does not seem warranted for this group. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Barriers include the need for longitudinal studies that cover relevant developmental stages and for samples large enough to deal with the challenge of testing gene-environment-development interaction. A solution to some of these problems is to bring together existing data sets that have the necessary characteristics. As part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded Gene-Environment-Development Initiative, our goal is to identify exactly which genes, which environments, and which developmental transitions together predict the development of drug use and misuse. Four data sets were used of which common characteristics include (1) general population samples, including males and females; (2) repeated measures across adolescence and young adulthood; (3) assessment of nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use and addiction; (4) measures of family and environmental risk; and (5) consent for genotyping DNA from blood or saliva. After quality controls, 2,962 individuals provided over 15,000 total observations. In the first gene-environment analyses, of alcohol misuse and stressful life events, some significant gene-environment and gene-development effects were identified. We conclude that in some circumstances, already collected data sets can be combined for gene-environment and gene-development analyses.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Risk of Five Common Psychiatric Disorders Among European Women: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study,"Jin, LY; Yu, J; Chen, YX; Pang, HY; Sheng, JZ; Huang, HF","Background: Observational studies have implied an association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and psychiatric disorders. Here we examined whether PCOS might contribute causally to such disorders, focusing on anxiety disorder (AD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Methods: Causality was explored using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variants as instrumental variables. The genetic variants were from summary data of genome-wide association studies in European populations. First, potential causal effects of PCOS on each psychiatric disorder were evaluated, and then potential reverse causality was also assessed once PCOS was found to be causally associated with any psychiatric disorder. Causal effects were explored using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger analysis, simulation extrapolation, and weighted median analysis. Results: Genetically predicted PCOS was positively associated with OCD based on inverse variance weighting (OR 1.339, 95% CI 1.083-1.657, p = 0.007), simulation extrapolation (OR 1.382, 95% CI 1.149-1.662, p = 0.009) and weighted median analysis (OR 1.493, 95% CI 1.145-1.946, p = 0.003). However, genetically predicted OCD was not associated with PCOS. Genetically predicted PCOS did not exert causal effects on AD, BIP, MDD, or SCZ.

This bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was to assess the causal associations of insomnia with depressive symptoms and subjective well-being.Methods: Summary statistics for insomnia, depressive symptoms, and subjective well-being were obtained from three large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European ancestry. MR analyses were mainly conducted with the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) method. The weighted-median method, MR-Egger method, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) test were adopted to test whether the estimates were robust. The adjusted MR analysis was performed to avoid the effect of potential pleiotropy.Results: There was evidence to support a causal association between genetically predicted insomnia and depressive symptoms (beta (beta) = 0.086, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.068 to 0.104, P = 8.6E-21). Meanwhile, genetically predicted depressive symptoms was associated with a higher risk of insomnia (beta = 0.543, 95% CI = 0.331 to 0.754, P = 4.8E-07).

Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate the phenotypic variance tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

When events were divided into those considered to be dependent or independent, an equal amount of variance was explained for both.

PCOS, possibly extending to men's health, imposes a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. Diagnosis in adults follows the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, requiring two out of three criteria - clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and/or specific ovarian morphological characteristics or elevated anti-Mullerian hormone. However, diagnosing adolescents omits ovarian morphology and anti-Mullerian hormone considerations. PCOS, marked by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, strongly contributes to early-onset type 2 diabetes, with increased odds for cardiovascular diseases. Reproduction-related implications include irregular menstrual cycles, anovulatory infertility, heightened risks of pregnancy complications and endometrial cancer. Beyond physiological manifestations, PCOS is associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction and negative body image, collectively contributing to diminished health-related quality of life in patients. Despite its high prevalence persisting into menopause, diagnosing PCOS often involves extended timelines and multiple health-care visits. Treatment remains ad hoc owing to limited understanding of underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for research delineating the aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome.

In particular, earlier age at menarche has been associated with elevated rates of depression in adolescents. Previous research suggests that this relationship may be causal, but replication and an investigation of whether this effect extends to other mental health domains is warranted. Methods In this Registered Report, we triangulated evidence from different causal inference methods using a new wave of data (N = 13,398) from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study. We combined multiple regression, one- and two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR), and negative control analyses (using pre-pubertal symptoms as outcomes) to assess the causal links between age at menarche and different domains of adolescent mental health. Results Our results supported the hypothesis that earlier age at menarche is associated with elevated depressive symptoms in early adolescence based on multiple regression (beta = - 0.11, 95% CI [- 0.12, - 0.09], p(one-tailed) < 0.01). One-sample MR analyses suggested that this relationship may be causal (beta = - 0.07, 95% CI [- 0.13, 0.00], p(one-tailed) = 0.03), but the effect was small, corresponding to just a 0.06 standard deviation increase in depressive symptoms with each earlier year of menarche. There was also some evidence of a causal relationship with depression diagnoses during adolescence based on one-sample MR (OR = 0.74, 95% CI [0.54, 1.01], p(one-tailed) = 0.03), corresponding to a 29% increase in the odds of receiving a depression diagnosis with each earlier year of menarche. Negative control and two-sample MR sensitivity analyses were broadly consistent with this pattern of results. Multivariable MR analyses accounting for the genetic overlap between age at menarche and childhood body size provided some evidence of confounding. Meanwhile, we found little consistent evidence of effects on other domains of mental health after accounting for co-occurring depression and other confounding.

In addition, trauma exposure has been implicated in risk for NSSI and suicide. Genetically informative studies are needed to determine common sources of liability to all three self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, and to clarify the nature of their associations with traumatic experiences.Methods: Multivariate biometric modeling was conducted using data from 9526 twins [59% female, mean age = 31.7 years (range 24-42)] from two cohorts of the Australian Twin Registry, some of whom also participated in the Childhood Trauma Study and the Nicotine Addiction Genetics Project.Results: The prevalences of high-risk trauma exposure (HRT), NSSI, SI, and SA were 24.4, 5.6, 27.1, and 4.6%, respectively. All phenotypes were moderately to highly correlated. Genetic influences on self-injurious thoughts and behaviors and HRT were significant and highly correlated among men [r(G) = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.37-0.81)] and women [r(G) = 0.56 (0.49-0.63)]. Unique environmental influences were modestly correlated in women [r(E) = 0.23 (0.01-0.45)], suggesting that high-risk trauma may confer some direct risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors among females.Conclusions: Individuals engaging in NSSI are at increased risk for suicide, and common heritable factors contribute to these associations.

Mothers of 7,706 girl and 7,418 boy twins from the Netherlands Twin Register rated the anxious depression scale (SxAnxDep) of the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) at age 7, 10, and 12 years. Two thousand seven hundred and six girl and 1,856 boy twins completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) at age 14, 16, and 18. While individual trajectories varied considerably, these differences were largely idiosyncratic and could not be grouped into separate latent classes with class-specific average growth curves. The intercept, which reflects the individuals' baseline level of SxAnxDep across time, explained 55-58% of the total phenotypic variance. The slope factor, which captures a common average trend over time, did not explain variance in the phenotype. This finding also underlines the high level of idiosyncrasy of trajectories that lack a common longitudinal structure. The analyses of twin data showed that the random intercept factor of SxAnxDep during childhood and during adolescence is considerably more heritable than the observations at any single age, namely between 60% and 84%. One explanation is that different factors contribute to the level of symptoms of anxiety and depression at any given time point, including temporary events and emotions. When considering baseline stability, these temporary influences average out, with the result of a more reliable and more heritable phenotype.

The aim of this novel observational longitudinal case-control study, ""Meals, Microbiota and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (MMM-Study)"" is to contribute to the promotion of treatment options for children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders through identification of patterns that may affect the symptoms. All children and adolescents, 5-15 years referred to the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, for one year (n.150) will be invited to participate. There are two control groups, i.e., sex-matched children from the same postal area (n approximate to 150) and same parent siblings (full siblings) in the same household close in age +/- 3 years (n<150). A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years' time, contributing to the high scientific value.

Health condition and socioeconomic status mediate the causal effect of reproductive traits on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: evidence from Mendelian randomization study,"Wang, QY; Wang, LM; Hao, R; Zhang, LJ; Wang, WY; Xia, LL","Background Observational data posits a correlation between reproductive traits and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but their causal inference is still unclear. This investigation seeks to elucidate the causal influence of reproductive traits on NAFLD and determine the intervening role of health condition and socioeconomic status in these connections.Methods Utilizing a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach, this research leveraged a comprehensive dataset from the Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) database. The study incorporated body mass index, major depression, educational level, household income and Townsend deprivation index as intermediary variables. Initially, a bidirectional two-sample MR study was conducted to explore the genetic associations between reproductive traits and NAFLD. Then, two-step MR analyses were implemented to quantify the extent of mediation by these indicators. The weighted inverse variance method was the primary analytical approach, complemented by several sensitivity analyses to affirm the robustness of the MR assumptions. Finally, these findings were validated in the FinnGen research.Results The bidirectional MR analysis indicated that earlier reproductive traits (age at menarche, age at first sexual intercourse, and age at first birth) were associated with an elevated risk of NAFLD, absent any evidence of the reverse relationship. Body mass index accounted for 35.64% of the association between premature menarche and NAFLD. Additionally, body mass index, major depression, educational level and household income mediated 41.65%, 14.35%, 37.88%, and 18.59% of the connection between early sexual intercourse and NAFLD, respectively. Similarly, these same variables elucidated 36.36%, 15.58%, 41.56%, and 22.73% of the correlation between younger age at first birth and NAFLD.Conclusion Our study elucidated the causal relationships between reproductive traits and NAFLD.

The prevalence of CD is substantially higher in males than females, and partly due to this, most research on this condition has used all-male or predominantly male samples. Although the number of females exhibiting CD has increased in recent decades, the majority of studies on neurobiological measures, neurocognitive phenotypes, and treatments for CD have focused on male subjects only, despite strong evidence for sex differences in the aetiology and neurobiology of CD. Here, we selectively review the existing literature on CD and related phenotypes in females, focusing in particular on sex differences in CD symptoms, patterns of psychiatric comorbidity, and callous-unemotional personality traits.

"Longitudinal associations between circulating interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in childhood, and eating disorders and disordered eating in adolescence","Solmi, F; Bulik, CM; De Stavola, BL; Dalman, C; Khandaker, GM; Lewis, G","Objective: Few studies have explored the association between inflammation and eating disorders and none used a longitudinal design. We investigated the association between serum-levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) measured in childhood and eating disorders and related behaviours and cognitions in adolescence in a large general population sample.Methods: We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Our exposures were thirds of IL6 and CRP derived from serum measurements taken at age nine years, and outcomes were eating disorder diagnoses and self-reported disordered eating behaviours at ages 14, 16, and 18 years. We used univariable and multivariable multilevel logistic regression models adjusting for a number of potential confounders, including sex, fat mass, and pre-existing mental health difficulties.Results: Our sample included 3480 children. Those in the top third of CRP had lower odds of binge eating (odds ratio(OR):0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.39,1.00,p ""equals"" 0.05) and fasting (OR:0.63, 95% CI:0.38,1.07,p ""equals"" 0.09) after adjustment for confounders. We also observed weak associations of comparable magnitude for purging, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. We did not find any associations between levels of IL6 and any of the outcomes under study.Conclusions: There was little evidence of an association between CRP and IL-6 and adolescent eating disorder outcomes. The inverse association observed between CRP and binge eating was unexpected, so caution is needed when interpreting it. One possible explanation is that higher CRP levels could have a protective role for disordered eating by affecting appetitive traits.",2020,,BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY,89,,491-500,WOS:000582897600047,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.040,,#4173,Solmi 2020,"",""
Development and Change in Attachment: A Multiwave Assessment of Attachment and Its Correlates Across Childhood and Adolescence,"Khan, F; Chong, JY; Theisen, JC; Fraley, RC; Young, JF; Hankin, BL","This research examines the contextual factors that facilitate development and change in attachment during later childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood using a longitudinal cohort design involving 690 children (7-19 years old) and their parents. At each wave, a variety of interpersonal variables (e.g., parent-child stress) were measured. We examined alternative developmental processes (i.e., long-term, catalytic, and short-term processes) that have not been previously distinguished in attachment research. Preregistered analyses revealed that nondevelopmental processes can explain the associations between almost all of the interpersonal variables of interest and attachment security, suggesting that previous research using traditional longitudinal methods may have misattributed nondevelopmental processes for developmental ones. For example, we found that friendship quality, although prospectively associated with attachment both in prior work and in the current study, was not developmentally associated with attachment. However, after controlling for nondevelopmental sources of covariation, we identified a number of developmental processes that may help explain change in attachment. For example, we found that initial levels of parental depression, as well as growth in parent-child stress, were related to growth in adolescent insecurity over 3 years. We also examined 12 genetic variants studied in previous research and found that they were not related to average levels or changes in attachment.

Association of Mental Disorder in Childhood and Adolescence With Subsequent Educational Achievement,"Dalsgaard, S; McGrath, J; Ostergaard, SD; Wray, NR; Pedersen, CB; Mortensen, PB; Petersen, L","This cohort study examines whether a mental disorder diagnosis, the type of disorder, and other variables play a role in the decision to take the ninth-grade final examination and in the examination outcome among young people in Denmark.Key PointsQuestionWhat are the educational achievements at the final examination of compulsory schooling in Denmark among individuals with or without a mental disorder? FindingsIn this nationwide cohort study of 629622 individuals, 52% of those with a mental disorder took the final examination compared with 88% of those without a mental disorder. Students with a mental disorder who took the examination attained considerably lower grades on the examination. MeaningThe findings of this study suggest that a mental disorder in childhood or adolescence is associated with lower educational achievements and that additional educational support for these individuals may be needed.ImportanceOnset of mental disorders during childhood or adolescence has been associated with underperformance in school and impairment in social and occupational life in adulthood, which has important implications for the affected individuals and society. ObjectiveTo compare the educational achievements at the final examination of compulsory schooling in Denmark between individuals with and those without a mental disorder. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based cohort study was conducted in Denmark and obtained data from the Danish Civil Registration System and other nationwide registers. The 2 cohorts studied were (1) all children who were born in Denmark between January 1, 1988, and July 1, 1999, and were alive at age 17 years (n=629622) and (2) all children who took the final examination at the end of ninth grade in both Danish and mathematics subjects between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2016 (n=542 500). Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2018, to March 1, 2019. ExposuresClinical diagnosis by a psychiatrist of any mental disorder or 1 of 29 specific mental disorders before age 16 years. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTaking the final examination at the end of ninth grade and mean examination grades standardized as z scores with differences measured in SDs (standardized mean grade difference). ResultsOf the total study population (n=629622; 306209 female and 323413 male), 523312 individuals (83%) took the final examination before 17 years of age and 38001 (6%) had a mental disorder before that age. Among the 542500 individuals (274332 female and 268168 male), the mean (SD) age was 16.1 (0.33) years for the females and 16.2 (0.34) years for the males. Among the 15843 female and 22158 male students with a mental disorder, a lower proportion took the final examination (0.52; 95% CI, 0.52-0.53) compared with individuals without a mental disorder (0.88; 95% CI, 0.88-0.88). Mental disorders affected the grades of male individuals (standardized mean grade difference, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.28) more than the grades of their female peers (standardized mean grade difference, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.22) when compared with same-sex individuals without mental disorders. Most specific mental disorders were associated with statistically significantly lower mean grades, with intellectual disability associated with the lowest grade in female and male students (standardized mean grade difference, -1.07 [95% CI, -1.23 to -0.91] and -1.03 [95% CI, -1.17 to -0.89]; P=.76 for sex differences in the mean grades).

For those with anxiety, attachment, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and other developmental disorders, female individuals attained relatively lower standardized mean grades compared with their male counterparts. Conclusions and RelevanceResults of this study suggest that, in Denmark, almost all mental disorders in childhood or adolescence may be associated with a lower likelihood of taking the final examination at the end of ninth grade; those with specific disorders tended to achieve lower mean grades on the examination; and female, compared with male, individuals with certain mental disorders appeared to have relatively more impairment.These findings appear to emphasize the need to provide educational support to young people with mental disorders.",2020,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,77,8,797-805,WOS:000561259100008,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0217,,#4187,Dalsgaard 2020,"",""
Investigating the causal impact of different types of physical activity on psychiatric disorders across life stages: A Mendelian randomization study,"Yu, L; Aziz, AUR; Zhang, X; Li, WS","Background: Psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety disorders, and dementia, manifest differently across life stages, impacting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral health. Understanding the causal relationships between various types of physical activity and these disorders is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Methods: The summary level data from GWAS was utilized to conduct a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. We assessed the potential causal relationships between different types of physical activity including light do it yourself (DIY) activities, heavy DIY activities, strenuous sports, and aerobic exercises/other exercises and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders (ADHD, depression, anxiety disorders, and dementia) across different life stages. Results: The MR analysis showed no causal relationship between light DIY activities and any of the psychiatric disorders studied. Heavy DIY activities showed a significant negative association with anxiety disorders but no links with ADHD, depression, or dementia. Strenuous sports did not demonstrate any causal relationship with the psychiatric disorders examined. Aerobic exercises were notably correlated with a reduced risk of depression, although no significant associations were found with ADHD, anxiety disorders, or dementia. Conclusions: The findings indicate that heavy DIY activities might contribute to reducing anxiety disorders, while aerobic exercises potentially lower the risk of depression.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome in the Field of Psychiatry: A Review,"Ishiguro, H; Yagasaki, H; Horiuchi, Y","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a series of rare hereditary connective tissue diseases characterized by joint hypermobility, joint dislocation, and hyperextensibility of the skin, as well as cardiovascular involvement. EDS is often associated with chronic widespread physical pain, which can lead to psychological pain. Poor awareness and limited diagnosis of EDS and related symptoms result in decreased self-esteem and confusion regarding physical sensation. Furthermore, EDS imposes substantial psychological burden on patients due to exercise restriction, scars, keloids, and subcutaneous fat accumulation on the extremities, which leads to parental overprotection and bullying experiences from other children at school age. Recent large-scale studies have suggested that patients with EDS have a higher risk of mood disorders than the general population. Other cohort studies indicated high prevalence of anorexia nervosa, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorder were found in patients with EDS. Case reports instead indicated that some psychiatric disorders were secondary symptoms due to physical problems from EDS.

Environment-by-PGS Interaction in the Classical Twin Design: An Application to Childhood Anxiety and Negative Affect,"Bruins, S; Hottenga, JJ; Neale, MC; Pool, R; Boomsma, DI; Dolan, CV","One type of genotype-environment interaction occurs when genetic effects on a phenotype are moderated by an environment; or when environmental effects on a phenotype are moderated by genes. Here we outline these types of genotype-environment interaction models, and propose a test of genotype-environment interaction based on the classical twin design, which includes observed genetic variables (polygenic scores: PGSs) that account for part of the genetic variance of the phenotype. We introduce environment-by-PGS interaction and the results of a simulation study to address statistical power and parameter recovery. Next, we apply the model to empirical data on anxiety and negative affect in children. The power to detect environment-by-PGS interaction depends on the heritability of the phenotype, and the strength of the PGS. The simulation results indicate that under realistic conditions of sample size, heritability and strength of the interaction, the environment-by-PGS model is a viable approach to detect genotype-environment interaction. In 7-year-old children, we defined two PGS based on the largest genetic association studies for 2 traits that are genetically correlated to childhood anxiety and negative affect, namely major depression (MDD) and intelligence (IQ). We find that common environmental influences on negative affect are amplified for children with a lower IQ-PGS.",2024,,MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH,59,6,1198-1210,WOS:001027573800001,10.1080/00273171.2023.2228763,,#4215,Bruins 2024,"",For Mahnoor's review?; PRS x life stress interaction
Causal relationship between cortical structural changes and onset of anxiety disorder: evidence from Mendelian randomization,"Teng, F; Wang, MQ; Lu, ZY; Zhang, CY; Xiao, LL; Chen, ZM; Huang, MS; Xie, LL; Chen, ZY; Wang, W","Previous studies have reported a correlation between anxiety disorders and changes in brain structure, yet the specific alterations in brain region volumes remain unclear. This study aimed to infer the causal relationship between anxiety disorders and changes in brain structure volume through Mendelian Randomization analysis. We selected 63 cortical structure volumes from the GWAS database as exposure data and anxiety disorder data from the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases as outcomes. We found a significant correlation between atrophy in the Left precentral volume area (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.935,95% Confidence intervals [CI]: 0.891-0.981, P value, P = 0.007) and an increased risk of anxiety disorders.

Gene-environment correlations and genetic confounding underlying the association between media use and mental health,"Ayorech, Z; Baldwin, JR; Pingault, JB; Rimfeld, K; Plomin, R","The increase in online media use and mental health problems have prompted investigations into their association, although most literature is focussed on deleterious effects.

Beyond the traditionally explored negative uses of online media (online victimisation and problematic internet use), we investigate general media uses such as posting online and watching videos and distinguish both positive (pro-social behaviour) and negative (anxiety, depression, peer and behaviour problems) mental health measures. Negative media use correlated with poor mental health (r = 0.11-0.32), but general media use correlated with prosocial behaviour (r = 0.20) and fewer behavioural problems (r = - 0.24). Twin analyses showed that both general and negative media use were moderately heritable (ranging from 20 to 49%) and their associations with mental health were primarily due to genetic influences (44-88%). Genetic sensitivity analysis combining polygenic scores with heritability estimates also suggest genetic confounding.

Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) functional haplotype is associated with recurrence of affective symptoms: A prospective birth cohort study,"Koike, S; Gaysina, D; Jones, PB; Wong, A; Richards, M","Background: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphisms play an essential role in dopamine availability in the brain. However, there has been no study investigating whether a functional four-SNP (rs6269rs4633- rs4818-rs4680) haplotype is associated with affective symptoms over the life course.Methods: We tested this using 2093 members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (MRC NSHD), who had been followed up since birth in 1946, and had data for COMT genotypes, adolescent emotional problems (age 13-15) and at least one measure of adult affective symptoms at ages 36, 43, 53, or 60-64 years. First, differences in the levels of affective symptoms by the functional haplotype using SNPs rs6269, rs4818, and rs4680 were tested in a structural equation model framework. Second, interactions between affective symptoms by COMT haplotype were tested under an additive model. Finally, a quadratic regressor (haplotype(2)) was used in a curvilinear model, to test for a possible inverted-U trend in affective symptoms according to COMT-related dopamine availability.Results: Women had a significant interaction between COMT haplotypes and adolescent emotional problem on affective symptoms at age 53. Post hoc analysis showed a significant positive association between adolescent emotional problems and affective symptoms at age 53 years in the middle dopamine availability group (valA/valB or met/met; beta = .11, p = .007).

Causal Effect of Age at Menarche on the Risk for Depression: Results From a Two-Sample Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Study,"Hirtz, R; Hars, C; Naaresh, R; Laabs, BH; Antel, J; Grasemann, C; Hinney, A; Hebebrand, J; Peters, T","A fair number of epidemiological studies suggest that age at menarche (AAM) is associated with depression, but the reported effect sizes are small, and there is evidence of residual confounding. Moreover, previous Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to avoid inferential problems inherent to epidemiological studies have provided mixed findings. To clarify the causal relationship between age at menarche and broadly defined depression risk, we used 360 genome-wide significantly AAM-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variable and data from the latest GWAS for the broadly defined depression risk on 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls). Multiple methods to account for heterogeneity of the instrumental variable (penalized weighted median, MR Lasso, and contamination mixture method), systematic and idiosyncratic pleiotropy (MR RAPS), and horizontal pleiotropy (MR PRESSO and multivariable MR using three methods) were used. Body mass index, education attainment, and total white blood count were considered pleiotropic phenotypes in the multivariable MR analysis.

Research Review: A review of the past decade of family and genomic studies on adolescent mental health,"Morneau-Vaillancourt, G; Palaiologou, E; Polderman, TJC; Eley, TC","BackgroundMental health problems and traits capturing psychopathology are common and often begin during adolescence. Decades of twin studies indicate that genetic factors explain around 50% of individual differences in adolescent psychopathology. In recent years, significant advances, particularly in genomics, have moved this work towards more translational findings.MethodsThis review provides an overview of the past decade of genetically sensitive studies on adolescent development, covering both family and genomic studies in adolescents aged 10-24 years. We focus on five research themes: (1) co-occurrence or comorbidity between psychopathologies, (2) stability and change over time, (3) intergenerational transmission, (4) gene-environment interplay, and (5) psychological treatment outcomes.ResultsFirst, research shows that much of the co-occurrence of psychopathologies in adolescence is explained by genetic factors, with widespread pleiotropic influences on many traits. Second, stability in psychopathology across adolescence is largely explained by persistent genetic influences, whereas change is explained by emerging genetic and environmental influences. Third, contemporary twin-family studies suggest that different co-occurring genetic and environmental mechanisms may account for the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology, with some differences across psychopathologies. Fourth, genetic influences on adolescent psychopathology are correlated with a wide range of environmental exposures. However, the extent to which genetic factors interact with the environment remains unclear, as findings from both twin and genomic studies are inconsistent. Finally, a few studies suggest that genetic factors may play a role in psychological treatment response, but these findings have not yet been replicated.ConclusionsGenetically sensitive research on adolescent psychopathology has progressed significantly in the past decade, with family and twin findings starting to be replicated at the genomic level.

The effects of life experiences and polygenic risk for depression on the development of positive and negative cognitive biases across adolescence: The CogBIAS hypothesis,"Zavlis, O; Parsons, S; Fox, E; Booth, C; Songco, A; Vincent, JP","The Cognitive Bias (CogBIAS) hypothesis proposes that cognitive biases develop as a function of environmental influences (which determine the valence of biases) and the genetic susceptibility to those influences (which determines the potency of biases). The current study employed a longitudinal, polygenic-by-environment approach to examine the CogBIAS hypothesis. To this end, measures of life experiences and polygenic scores for depression were used to assess the development of memory and interpretation biases in a three-wave sample of adolescents (12-16 years) (N = 337). Using mixed effects modeling, three patterns were revealed. First, positive life experiences (PLEs) were found to diminish negative and enhance positive forms of memory and social interpretation biases. Second, and against expectation, negative life experiences and depression polygenic scores were not associated with any cognitive outcomes, upon adjusting for psychopathology. Finally, and most importantly, the interaction between high polygenic risk and greater PLEs was associated with a stronger positive interpretation bias for social situations. These results provide the first line of polygenic evidence in support of the CogBIAS hypothesis, but also extend this hypothesis by highlighting positive genetic and nuanced environmental influences on the development of cognitive biases across adolescence.",2024,,DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,,,,WOS:001147013700001,10.1017/S0954579423001645,,#4256,Zavlis 2024,"",For Mahnoor's review?

Participants in the Twins Early Development Study (aged 16.32 +/- .68 years) completed subjective wellbeing and life events assessments via two separate studies (overlapping N for wellbeing and life events measures ranged from 3527 to 9350). We conducted bivariate twin models between both positive and negative life events with subjective wellbeing and related positive psychological traits including subjective happiness, life satisfaction, optimism, hopefulness and gratitude measured at 16 years. Results suggested that the heritability of life events can partially be explained by shared genetic influences with the wellbeing indicators. Wellbeing traits were positively genetically correlated with positive life events and negatively correlated with negative life events (except curiosity where there was no correlation). Those positive traits that drive behaviour (grit and ambition) showed the highest genetic correlation with life events, whereas the reflective trait gratitude was less correlated. This suggests that gene-environment correlations might explain the observed genetic association between life events and wellbeing.

Birth Weight and Development: Bias or Heterogeneity by Polygenic Risk Factors?,"Conley, D; Sotoudeh, R; Laidley, T","Birth weight has long been known to be a proxy for prenatal nutrition as well as social stress during pregnancy and, in this vein, has important associations with life outcomes ranging from infant mortality to cognition to adult stature. However, since birth weight and such developmental outcomes may share a genetic etiology, here we compare estimates of the effect of birth weight on traits with and without controls for genotype. Moreover, a recent literature has suggested that the effects of birth weight on later outcomes may be moderated by genotype. Namely, a handful of studies have assessed whether alleles putatively associated with neural plasticity interact with birth weight in twin and sibling models and have come to conflicting results. This confusion may result from the fact that these researchers have used only candidate gene markers-that is single alleles or a combination of a few alleles. Candidate gene studies, in turn, have failed to replicate and the general consensus in the genetics of behavior literature is that most published associations are false positives. To improve on this prior work, the present study uses well-validated, replicated polygenic scores that combine information across the entire genome by summarizing the effects of over one million individual alleles. Specifically, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and the UK Biobank to assess whether the effects birth weight on cognitive functioning, educational attainment, height, body mass index, smoking, and depression are biased by or moderated by each phenotype's respective polygenic score.

Are Stressful Developmental Processes of Youths Leading to Health Problems Amplified by Genetic Polymorphisms?

Consistent with the life course-stress process perspective, we hypothesized that early socioeconomic adversity initiates a stress process over the early life course. This process involves the disrupted transition from adolescence to young adulthood, which increases the risk of health problems during young adulthood. Behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic data were collected from 12,424 adolescents (53 % female) over a period of 13 years participating in the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Early cumulative socioeconomic adversity and the polygenic influence were measured using composite indices. The study provided evidence for stressful developmental processes of adolescents, involving parental rejection, depressive symptoms, and adolescents' precocious transition. This longitudinal process was initiated by early cumulative socioeconomic adversity and eventuated with young adults' increased body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the study provided evidence for the influence of life context-gene interactions (G x E) on adolescents' precocious development and young adult BMI (after controlling for the lagged measure) amplifying the stress process over the early life course. These findings emphasize the need for incorporating individual genetic characteristics in a longitudinal context into life course stress research.

Evidence for the Risks and Consequences of Adolescent Cannabis Exposure,"Levine, A; Clemenza, K; Rynn, M; Lieberman, J","Objective: This review of the scientific literature examines the potential adult sequelae of exposure to cannabis and related synthetic cannabinoids in adolescence. We examine the four neuropsychiatric outcomes that are likely most vulnerable to alteration by early cannabinoid use, as identified within both the clinical and preclinical research: cognition, emotional functioning, risk for psychosis, and addiction.Method: A literature search was conducted through PubMed, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar with no publication date restrictions. The search terms used were ""adolescent"" and ""adult,"" and either ""cannabis,"" ""marijuana,"" ""delta-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol,"" or ""cannabinoid,"" which was then crossed with one or more of the following terms: ""deficit,"" ""impairment,"" ""alteration,"" ""long-term,"" ""persistent,"" ""development,"" ""maturation,"" and ""pubescent.""Results: The majority of the clinical and preclinical data point to a strong correlation between adolescent cannabinoid exposure and persistent, adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes in adulthood. Although the literature supports the hypothesis that adolescent cannabis use is connected to impaired cognition and mental health in adults, it does not conclusively demonstrate that cannabis consumption alone is sufficient to cause these deficits in humans. The animal literature, however, clearly indicates that adolescent-onset exposure to cannabinoids can catalyze molecular processes that lead to persistent functional deficits in adulthood, deficits that are not found to follow adult-onset exposure and that model some of the adverse outcomes reported in humans among adult populations of early-onset cannabis users.Conclusion: Based on the data in the current literature, a strong association is found between early, frequent, and heavy adolescent cannabis exposure and poor cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in adulthood, yet definite conclusions cannot yet be made as to whether cannabis use alone has a negative impact on the human adolescent brain.

Biological Factors Underpinning Suicidal Behaviour: An Update,"Chahla, MA; Khalil, MI; Comai, S; Brundin, L; Erhardt, S; Guillemin, GJ","Suicide, a global health burden, represents the 17th leading cause of death worldwide (1.3%), but the 4th among young people aged between 15 and 29 years of age, according to World Health Organization (WHO), 2019. Suicidal behaviour is a complex, multi-factorial, polygenic and independent mental health problem caused by a combination of alterations and dysfunctions of several biological pathways and disruption of normal mechanisms in brain regions that remain poorly understood and need further investigation to be deciphered. Suicide complexity and unpredictability gained international interest as a field of research. Several studies have been conducted at the neuropathological, inflammatory, genetic, and molecular levels to uncover the triggers behind suicidal behaviour and develop convenient and effective therapeutic or at least preventive procedures. This review aims to summarise and focus on current knowledge of diverse biological pathways involved in the neurobiology of suicidal behaviour, and briefly highlights future potential therapeutic pathways to prevent or even treat this significant public health problem.",2023,,BRAIN SCIENCES,13,3,,WOS:000955158900001,10.3390/brainsci13030505,,#4293,Chahla 2023,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"
Striatal dopamine gene network moderates the effect of early adversity on the risk for adult psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidity,"Barth, B; Arcego, DM; de Mendonca, EJ; de Lima, RMS; Parent, C; Dalmaz, C; Portella, AK; Pokhvisneva, I; Meaney, MJ; Silveira, PP","Cardiometabolic and psychiatric disorders often co-exist and share common early life risk factors, such as low birth weight. However, the biological pathways linking early adversity to adult cardiometabolic/psychiatric comorbidity remain unknown. Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the striatum is sensitive to early adversity and influences the development of both cardiometabolic and psychiatric diseases. Here we show that a co-expression based polygenic score (ePGS) reflecting individual variations in the expression of the striatal dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) network significantly interacts with birth weight to predict psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities in both adults (UK Biobank, N = 225,972) and adolescents (ALSPAC, N = 1188). Decreased birth weight is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities, but the effect is dependent on a striatal SLC6A3 ePGS, that reflects individual variation in gene expression of genes coexpressed with the SLC6A3 gene in the striatum. Neuroanatomical analyses revealed that SNPs from the striatum SLC6A3 ePGS were significantly associated with prefrontal cortex gray matter density, suggesting a neuroanatomical basis for the link between early adversity and psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidity.

Early life stress modulates the genetic influence on brain structure and cognitive function in children,"Wang, HH; Moon, SY; Kim, H; Kim, G; Ahn, WY; Joo, YY; Cha, JK","The enduring influence of early life stress (ELS) on brain and cognitive development has been widely acknowledged, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. We hypothesize that ELS might disrupt the genome-wide influence on brain morphology and connectivity development, consequently exerting a detrimental impact on children's cognitive ability. We analyzed the multimodal data of DNA genotypes, brain imaging (structural and diffusion MRI), and neurocognitive battery (NIH Toolbox) of 4276 children (ages 9-10 years, European ancestry) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The genome-wide influence on cognitive function was estimated using the polygenic score (GPS). By using brain morphometry and tractography, we identified the brain correlates of the cognition GPSs. Statis-tical analyses revealed relationships for the gene-brain-cognition pathway. The brain structural variance significantly mediated the genetic influence on cognition (indirect effect = 0.016, P-FDR < 0.001). Of note, this gene-brain relationship was significantly modulated by abuse, resulting in diminished cognitive capacity (Index of Moderated Mediation = -0.007; 95 % CI = -0.012 similar to -0.002).

The Effects of Childhood Maltreatment on Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Male Adolescents: The Moderating Roles of the Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) Gene and the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Gene,"Gao, YM; Xiong, YK; Liu, X; Wang, H","(1) Background: Numerous studies suggest strong associations between childhood maltreatment and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI); this is also true for the roles of dopaminergic genes in the etiology of some psychopathologies related to NSSI.

Prolonged parent-child separation and pain in adolescence: The role of HPA-axis genetic variations,"Chen, XX; Xu, LPA; Zeng, CC; Zhang, XY; Tao, FBA; Sun, Y","Background: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that childhood adversity was a predictor of pain and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genetic variation is associated with pain risk. This study aims to explore possible effects of prolonged childhood separation from parents and HPA polygenic risk score (PRS) on pain among adolescents in rural China. Method: We used data from 219 adolescents in rural area of Fuyang city, Anhui province, China. Parent-child separation was collected through interview and pain intensity was reported using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale. SNP genotyping was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique. The PRS was computed based on 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 genes (FKBP5 and NR3C1) related to HPA-axis stress reactivity. Results: Pain among adolescents separated from both parents scored higher compared to those without parentchild separation, however, this association was only observed in adolescents with moderate to high tertiles of PRS groups (parent-child separation in moderate group vs. no parent-child separation in moderate group: 3.07 vs. 1.57, P < 0.001; parent-child separation in highest group vs. no parent-child separation in highest group: 3.02 vs. 1.26, P < 0.001; parent-child separation in lowest group vs. no parent-child separation in lowest group: 2.34 vs. 1.25, P = 0.225). After controlled for demographic characteristics, psychopathological symptoms, adverse childhood experiences, parental warmth, prolonged childhood parent-child separation increased pain scores by 1.52 points (95% CI:0.72, 2.33) and 1.72 points (95% CI:1.13, 2.31) in moderate and high PRS groups, respectively.

Psychological resilience and neurodegenerative risk: A connectomics-transcriptomics investigation in healthy adolescent and middle females,"Petrican, R; Fornito, A; Jones, N","Adverse life events can inflict substantial long-term damage, which, paradoxically, has been posited to stem from initially adaptative responses to the challenges encountered in one's environment. Thus, identification of the mechanisms linking resilience against recent stressors to longer-term psychological vulnerability is key to understanding optimal functioning across multiple timescales. To address this issue, our study tested the relevance of neuro-reproductive maturation and senescence, respectively, to both resilience and longer-term risk for pathologies characterised by accelerated brain aging, specifically, Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Graph theoretical and partial least squares analyses were conducted on multimodal imaging, reported biological aging and recent adverse experience data from the Lifespan Human Connectome Project (HCP). Availability of reproductive maturation/senescence measures restricted our investigation to adolescent ( N = 178) and middle-aged ( N = 146) females. Psychological resilience was linked to age-specific brain senescence patterns suggestive of precocious functional development of somatomotor and control-relevant networks (adolescence) and earlier aging of default mode and salience/ventral attention systems (middle adulthood). Biological aging showed complementary associations with the neural patterns relevant to resilience in adolescence (positive relationship) versus middle-age (negative relationship). Transcriptomic and expression quantitative trait locus data analyses linked the neural aging patterns correlated with psychological resilience in middle adulthood to gene expression patterns suggestive of increased AD risk. Our results imply a partially antagonistic relationship between resilience against proximal stressors and longer-term psychological adjustment in later life. They thus underscore the importance of fine-tuning extant views on successful coping by considering the multiple timescales across which age-specific processes may unfold.",2022,,NEUROIMAGE,255,,,WOS:000796291800004,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119209,,#4301,Petrican 2022,"",""
The genetic and environmental etiology of child maltreatment in a parent-based extended family design,"Pittner, K; van Ijzendoorn, MH; Alink, LRA; Buisman, RSM; Compier-de Block, LHCGC; van den Berg, LJM; Elzinga, BM; Lindenberg, J; Tollenaar, MS; Diego, VP; Bakermans-Kranenburg, MJ","Child maltreatment has been associated with various cumulative risk factors. However, little is known about the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual differences between parents in perpetrating child maltreatment. To estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to perpetrating maltreatment we used a parent-based extended family design. Child-reported perpetrated maltreatment was available for 556 parents (283 women) from 63 families. To explore reporter effects (i.e., child perspective on maltreatment), child reports were compared to multi-informant reports. Based on polygenic model analyses, most of the variance related to the perpetration of physical abuse and emotional neglect was explained by common environmental factors (physical abuse: c(2) = 59%, SE = 12%, p = .006; emotional neglect: c(2) = 47%, SE = 8%, p < .001) whereas genetic factors did not significantly contribute to the model. For perpetrated emotional abuse, in contrast, genetic factors did significantly contribute to perpetrated emotional abuse (h(2) = 33%, SE = 8%, p < .001), whereas common environment factors did not. Multi-informant reports led to similar estimates of genetic and common environmental effects on all measures except for emotional abuse, where a multi-informant approach yielded higher estimates of the common environmental effects. Overall, estimates of unique environment, including measurement error, were lower using multi-informant reports. In conclusion, our findings suggest that genetic pathways play a significant role in perpetrating emotional abuse, while physical abuse and emotional neglect are transmitted primarily through common environmental factors.

A person-centered data analytic approach to dopaminergic polygenic moderation of child maltreatment exposure,"Handley, ED; Russotti, J; Ross, AJ; Toth, SL; Cicchetti, D","The present study illustrates the utility of latent class analysis, a person-centered data analytic approach, as an innovative method for identifying naturally occurring patterns of polygenic risk, specifically within the dopaminergic system. Moreover, this study tests whether latent classes of polygenic variation moderate the effect of child maltreatment exposure on internalizing symptoms among African ancestry youth. African ancestry youth were selected for this study because youth of color are overrepresented in the child welfare system and because African ancestry individuals are significantly underrepresented in genomics research. Results identified three latent classes of dopaminergic gene variation. Class 1 was marked predominately by homozygous minor alleles, Class 2 was characterized by homozygous major and heterozygous presentations, and Class 3 was marked by heterozygous alleles on the DAT-1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a combination of homozygous major and minor alleles on the other SNPs. Results indicated that a greater number of maltreatment subtypes experienced were associated with higher internalizing symptoms only for children with the latent polygenic Class 2 pattern. This latent class was distinctly characterized by more homozygous major or heterozygous allelic presentations along all three DAT-1 SNPs. This significant latent polygenic class by environment interaction was replicated in an independent replication sample. Together, findings suggest that African ancestry children with a pattern of dopaminergic variation characterized by this specific combination of polygenic variation are more vulnerable to developing internalizing symptoms following maltreatment exposure, relative to their peers with other dopamine-related polygenic patterns.",2023,,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY,65,5,,WOS:000994010000001,10.1002/dev.22403,,#4304,Handley 2023,"",""

The present study aimed to conduct the first meta-analysis that tested whether and how an important dopaminergic genethe catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene contributed to differences in child and adolescent environmental sensitivity. A total of 22 studies with 20,528 participants involving in various developmental outcomes (e.g., externalizing problems, emotional problems, cognitive development and social behaviors) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled effect size of environment-outcome associations in the Met-allele carriers (r=0.11, 95% CI=[0.07, 0.15], p<.001) did not significantly differ from that in the Val/Val homozygotes (r=0.14, 95% CI=[0.08, 0.20], p<0.001) (Q(contrast) (1)=0.37, p=0.54). The aggregated Liptak-Stouffer Z-score that combined the p-values of the COMT-environment interaction yield a nonsignificant result (p=0.52). Moreover, outcome domain, sample age, ethnicity and assessment methods for the environment and the outcome did not moderate the effect sizes.

Developmental mediation of genetic variation in response to the Fast Track prevention program,"Conduct Problems Prevention Res; Albert, D; Belsky, DW; Crowley, DM; Bates, JE; Pettit, GS; Lansford, JE; Dick, D; Dodge, KA","We conducted a developmental analysis of genetic moderation of the effect of the Fast Track intervention on adult externalizing psychopathology. The Fast Track intervention enrolled 891 children at high risk to develop externalizing behavior problems when they were in kindergarten. Half of the enrolled children were randomly assigned to receive 10 years of treatment, with a range of services and resources provided to the children and their families, and the other half to usual care (controls). We previously showed that the effect of the Fast Track intervention on participants' risk of externalizing psychopathology at age 25 years was moderated by a variant in the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Children who carried copies of the A allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs10482672 had the highest risk of externalizing psychopathology if they were in the control arm of the trial and the lowest risk of externalizing psychopathology if they were in the treatment arm. In this study, we test a developmental hypothesis about the origins of this for better and for worse Gene x Intervention interaction (G x I): that the observed G x I effect on adult psychopathology is mediated by the proximal impact of intervention on childhood externalizing problems and adolescent substance use and delinquency. We analyzed longitudinal data tracking the 270 European American children in the Fast Track randomized control trial with available genetic information (129 intervention children, 141 control group peers, 69% male) from kindergarten through age 25 years. Results show that the same pattern of for better and for worse susceptibility to intervention observed at the age 25 follow-up was evident already during childhood. At the elementary school follow-ups and at the middle/high school follow-ups, rs10482672 predicted better adjustment among children receiving the Fast Track intervention and worse adjustment among children in the control condition. In turn, these proximal G x I effects early in development mediated the ultimate G x I effect on externalizing psychopathology at age 25 years.

Sex differences in the dynamics of brain maturation during adolescence may be of particular importance with regard to vulnerability of the male brain to cannabis exposure. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the association between cannabis use and cortical maturation in adolescents is moderated by a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observation of 3 population-based samples included initial analysis in 1024 adolescents of both sexes from the Canadian Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) and follow-up in 426 adolescents of both sexes from the IMAGEN Study from 8 European cities and 504 male youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) based in England. A total of 1577 participants (aged 12-21 years; 899 [57.0%] male) had (1) information about cannabis use; (2) imaging studies of the brain; and (3) a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia across 108 genetic loci identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Data analysis was performed from March 1 through December 31, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cortical thickness derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Linear regression tests were used to assess the relationships between cannabis use, cortical thickness, and risk score. RESULTS Across the 3 samples of 1574 participants, a negative association was observed between cannabis use in early adolescence and cortical thickness in male participants with a high polygenic risk score. This observation was not the case for low-risk male participants or for the low-or high-risk female participants. Thus, in SYS male participants, cannabis use interacted with risk score vis-a-vis cortical thickness (P = .009); higher scores were associated with lower thickness only in males who used cannabis. Similarly, in the IMAGEN male participants, cannabis use interacted with increased risk score vis-a-vis a change in decreasing cortical thickness from 14.5 to 18.5 years of age (t(137) = -2.36; P = .02). Finally, in the ALSPAC high-risk group of male participants, those who used cannabis most frequently (&gt;= 61 occasions) had lower cortical thickness than those who never used cannabis (difference in cortical thickness, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01-0.12]; P = .02) and those with light use (&lt;5 occasions) (difference in cortical thickness, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.03-0.18]; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cannabis use in early adolescence moderates the association between the genetic risk for schizophrenia and cortical maturation among male individuals. This finding implicates processes underlying cortical maturation in mediating the link between cannabis use and liability to schizophrenia.",2015,,JAMA Psychiatry,72,10,1002-1011,,,,#4406,French 2015,"",""
Post-GWAS analysis of six substance use traits improves the identification and functional interpretation of genetic risk loci,"Marees, Andries T.; Gamazon, Eric R.; Gerring, Zachary; Vorspan, Florence; Fingal, Josh; van den Brink, Wim; Smit, Dirk J.A.; Verweij, Karin J.H.; Kranzler, Henry R.; Sherva, Richard; Farrer, Lindsay; Gelernter, Joel; Derks, Eske M.; Characteristics and determinants","Little is known about the functional mechanisms through which genetic loci associated with substance use traits ascertain their effect. This study aims to identify and functionally annotate loci associated with substance use traits based on their role in genetic regulation of gene expression. Methods: We evaluated expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) from 13 brain regions and whole blood of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and from whole blood of the Depression Genes and Networks (DGN) database. The role of single eQTLs was examined for six substance use traits: alcohol consumption (N = 537,349), cigarettes per day (CPD; N = 263,954), former vs. current smoker (N = 312,821), age of smoking initiation (N = 262,990), ever smoker (N = 632,802), and cocaine dependence (N = 4,769). Subsequently, we conducted a gene level analysis of gene expression on these substance use traits using S-PrediXcan. Results: Using an FDR-adjusted p-value <0.05 we found 2,976 novel candidate genetic loci for substance use traits, and identified genes and tissues through which these loci potentially exert their effects.

To date, genetic predictors of OCD treatment response have not been systematically investigated using genome-wide association study (GWAS). To identify specific genetic variations potentially influencing SRI response, we conducted a GWAS study in 804 OCD patients with information on SRI response. SRI response was classified as 'response' (n=514) or 'non-response' (n=290), based on self-report. We used the more powerful Quasi-Likelihood Score Test (the MQLS test) to conduct a genome-wide association test correcting for relatedness, and then used an adjusted logistic model to evaluate the effect size of the variants in probands. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was rs17162912 (P=1.76  10(-8)), which is near the DISP1 gene on 1q41-q42, a microdeletion region implicated in neurological development. The other six SNPs showing suggestive evidence of association (P<10(-5)) were rs9303380, rs12437601, rs16988159, rs7676822, rs1911877 and rs723815. Among them, two SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium, rs7676822 and rs1911877, located near the PCDH10 gene, gave P-values of 2.86  10(-6) and 8.41  10(-6), respectively. The other 35 variations with signals of potential significance (P<10(-4)) involve multiple genes expressed in the brain, including GRIN2B, PCDH10 and GPC6.

Genome-wide association study of antisocial personality disorder diagnostic criteria provides evidence for shared risk factors across disorders,"Li, Wenqianglong; Zhou, Hang; Thygesen, Johan H; Heydtmann, Mathis; Smith, Iain; Degenhardt, Franziska; Nthen, Markus; Morgan, Marsha Y; Kranzler, Henry R; Gelernter, Joel; Bass, Nicholas; Mcquillin, Andrew","While progress has been made in determining the genetic basis of antisocial behaviour, little progress has been made for antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), a condition that often co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions including substance use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety disorders. This study aims to improve the understanding of the genetic risk for ASPD and its relationship with other disorders and traits. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the number of ASPD diagnostic criteria data from 3217 alcohol-dependent participants recruited in the UK (UCL, N = 644) and the USA (Yale-Penn, N = 2573). We identified rs9806493, a chromosome 15 variant, that showed a genome-wide significant association ( Z -score = -5.501, P = 3.77??10 -8 ) with ASPD criteria. rs9806493 is an eQTL for SLCO3A1 (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 3A1), a ubiquitously expressed gene with strong expression in brain regions that include the anterior cingulate and frontal cortices. Polygenic risk score analysis identified positive correlations between ASPD and smoking, ADHD, depression traits, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative correlations were observed between ASPD PRS and alcohol intake frequency, reproductive traits, and level of educational attainment. This study provides evidence for an association between ASPD risk and SLCO3A1 and provides insight into the genetic architecture and pleiotropic associations of ASPD.

No genetic association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Parkinson's disease in nine ADHD candidate SNPs,"Geissler, Julia M; International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium members; Romanos, Marcel; Gerlach, Manfred; Berg, Daniela; Schulte, Claudia","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) involve pathological changes in brain structures such as the basal ganglia, which are essential for the control of motor and cognitive behavior and impulsivity. The cause of ADHD and PD remains unknown, but there is increasing evidence that both seem to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous cellular processes and brain regions. To explore the possibility of common genetic pathways within the respective pathophysiologies, nine ADHD candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes were tested for association with PD in 5333 cases and 12,019 healthy controls: one variant, respectively, in the genes coding for synaptosomal-associated protein 25k (SNAP25), the dopamine (DA) transporter (SLC6A3; DAT1), DA receptor D4 (DRD4), serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 and three SNPs in cadherin 13 (CDH13). Information was extracted from a recent meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies, in which 7,689,524 SNPs in European samples were successfully imputed. No significant association was observed after correction for multiple testing.

The next step is to use these results to increase our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved. Most of the identified variants likely influence gene regulation. The aim of the current study is to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the genetic signals and prioritize genes by integrating GWAS results with gene expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) levels. We applied summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to integrate ADHD and ASD GWAS data with fetal brain expression and methylation quantitative trait loci, given the early onset of these disorders. We also analyzed expression and methylation quantitative trait loci datasets of adult brain and blood, as these provide increased statistical power. We subsequently used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to investigate if the same variant influences both DNAm and gene expression levels. We identified multiple gene expression and DNAm levels in fetal brain at chromosomes 1 and 17 that were associated with ADHD and ASD, respectively, through pleiotropy at shared genetic variants. The analyses in brain and blood showed additional associated gene expression and DNAm levels at the same and additional loci, likely because of increased statistical power. Several of the associated genes have not been identified in ADHD and ASD GWASs before. Our findings identified the genetic variants associated with ADHD and ASD that likely act through gene regulation. This facilitates prioritization of candidate genes for functional follow-up studies.

Secondary analysis examined the relationships between lifetime cannabis use, PRS-Sz and the various sub-scales of the CAPE-42. Sensitivity analyses including covariates, including a PRS for cannabis use, were conducted and results were replicated using data from 1223 individuals in the Dutch Utrecht cannabis cohort. PRS-Sz significantly predicted cannabis use (p = 0.027) and PLE (p = 0.004) in the IMAGEN cohort.

Results remained consistent in the Utrecht cohort and through sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of a mediation or moderation effects. These results suggest that cannabis use remains a risk factor for PLEs, over and above genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia.

Polygenic risk scores for alcohol involvement relate to brain structure in substance-nave children: Results from the ABCD study,"Hatoum, Alexander S; Johnson, Emma C; Baranger, David A A; Paul, Sarah E; Agrawal, Arpana; Bogdan, Ryan","Brain imaging-derived structural correlates of alcohol involvement have largely been speculated to arise as a consequence of alcohol exposure. However, they may also reflect predispositional risk. In substance nave children of European ancestry who completed the baseline session of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n=3013), mixed-effects models estimated whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for problematic alcohol use (PAU-PRS) and drinks per week (DPW-PRS) are associated with magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain structure phenotypes (i.e., total and regional: cortical thickness, surface area and volume; subcortical volume; white matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity). Follow-up analyses evaluated whether any identified regions were also associated with polygenic risk among substance nave children of African ancestry (n=898). After adjustment for multiple testing correction, polygenic risk for PAU was associated with lower volume of the left frontal pole and greater cortical thickness of the right supramarginal gyrus (|?s|?>?0.009; ps?<?0.001; psfdr ?<?0.046; r2 s?<?0.004). PAU PRS and DPW PRS showed nominally significant associations with a host of other regional brain structure phenotypes (e.g., insula surface area and volume). None of these regions showed any, even nominal association among children of African ancestry. Genomic liability to alcohol involvement may manifest as variability in brain structure during middle childhood prior to alcohol use initiation. Broadly, alcohol-related variability in brain morphometry may partially reflect predisposing genomic influence.

We used automated image analysis to compare brain structural changes over time in people at elevated risk of schizophrenia for familial reasons who did and did not use cannabis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from subjects at high familial risk of schizophrenia at entry to the Edinburgh High Risk Study (EHRS) and approximately 2 years later. Differential grey matter (GM) loss in those exposed (n=23) and not exposed to cannabis (n=32) in the intervening period was compared using tensor-based morphometry (TBM).

"Neural systems for social cognition: gray matter volume abnormalities in boys at high genetic risk of autism symptoms, and a comparison with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder","Goddard, Marcia N; Swaab, Hanna; Rombouts, Serge A R B; Van Rijn, Sophie","Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is associated with several physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences. In terms of social development, there is an increased risk of autism symptomatology. However, it remains unclear how social deficits are related to abnormal brain development and to what degree underlying mechanisms of social dysfunction in 47, XXY are similar to, or different from, those in idiopathic autism (ASD). This study was aimed at investigating the neural architecture of brain structures related to social information processing in boys with 47, XXY, also in comparison with boys with idiopathic ASD. MRI scans of 16 boys with 47, XXY, 16 with ASD, and 16 nonclinical, male controls were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A region of interest mask containing the superior temporal cortex, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insular cortex, and medial frontal cortex was used. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used to assess degree of autism spectrum symptoms. The 47, XXY group could not be distinguished from the ASD group on mean SRS scores, and their scores were significantly higher than in controls. VBM showed that boys with 47, XXY have significant gray matter volume reductions in the left and right insula, and the left OFC, compared with controls and boys with ASD. Additionally, boys with 47, XXY had significantly less gray matter in the right superior temporal gyrus than controls. These results imply social challenges associated with 47, XXY may be rooted in neural anatomy, and autism symptoms in boys with 47, XXY and boys with ASD might have, at least partially, different underlying etiologies.",2016,,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,266,6,523-31,,10.1007/s00406-015-0623-z,,#4498,Goddard 2016,"",""

To estimate the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of anxiety and stress-related disorders; to identify novel genetic risk variants, genes, or biological pathways; to test for pleiotropic associations with other psychiatric traits; and to evaluate the association of psychiatric comorbidities with genetic findings. This genome-wide association study included individuals with various anxiety and stress-related diagnoses and controls derived from the population-based Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH) study. Lifetime diagnoses of anxiety and stress-related disorders were obtained through the national Danish registers. Genes of interest were further evaluated in mice exposed to chronic social defeat. The study was conducted between June 2016 and November 2018. Diagnoses of a relatively broad diagnostic spectrum of anxiety and stress-related disorders. The study sample included 12?655 individuals with various anxiety and stress-related diagnoses and 19?225 controls. Overall, 17?740 study participants (55.6%) were women. A total of 7308 participants (22.9%) were born between 1981-1985, 8840 (27.7%) between 1986-1990, 8157 (25.6%) between 1991-1995, 5918 (18.6%) between 1996-2000, and 1657 (5.2%) between 2001-2005.

A framework of sensitivity analyses adjusting for mental comorbidity supported this result showing consistent association of PDE4B variants with anxiety and stress-related disorder across analytical scenarios.

We also found a single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability of 28% (standard error?=?0.027) and that the genetic signature of anxiety and stress-related overlapped with psychiatric traits, educational outcomes, obesity-related phenotypes, smoking, and reproductive success. This study highlights anxiety and stress-related disorders as complex heritable phenotypes with intriguing genetic correlations not only with psychiatric traits, but also with educational outcomes and multiple obesity-related phenotypes.

No single nucleotide polymorphisms were strongly associated with treatment outcomes. No significant estimate of h(SNP)(2) could be obtained, suggesting the heritability of therapy outcome is smaller than our analysis was powered to detect.

The Expression of Genetic Risk for Aggressive and Non-aggressive Antisocial Behavior is Moderated by Peer Group Norms,"Vitaro, Frank; Brendgen, Mara; Girard, Alain; Boivin, Michel; Dionne, Ginette; Tremblay, Richard E","Numerous studies have shown that aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behaviors are important precursors of later adjustment problems. There is also strong empirical evidence that both types of antisocial behavior are partially influenced by genetic factors. However, despite its important theoretical and practical implications, no study has examined the question whether environmental factors differentially moderate the expression of genetic influences on the two types of antisocial behavior. Using a genetically informed design based on 266 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, this study examined whether the expression of genetic risk for aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior varies depending on the peer group's injunctive norms (i.e., the degree of acceptability) of each type of antisocial behavior. Self-reported aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior and classroom-based sociometric nominations were collected when participants were 10years old. Multivariate genetic analyses revealed some common genetic factors influencing both types of antisocial behavior (i.e., general antisocial behavior) as well as genetic influences specific to non-aggressive antisocial behavior. However, genetic influences on general antisocial behavior, as well as specific genetic influences on non-aggressive antisocial behavior, vary depending on the injunctive classroom norms regarding these behaviors. These findings speak to the power of peer group norms in shaping aggressive and non-aggressive antisocial behavior. They also contribute further to understanding the distinctive development of both types of antisocial behavior. Finally, they may have important implications for prevention purposes.",2015,,Journal of youth and adolescence,44,7,1379-95,,10.1007/s10964-015-0296-y,,#4510,Vitaro 2015,"",""

Serotonin as modulator of behavior and implication of serotonergic dysfunction in ASD etiology corroborates that serotonergic system genes are potential candidates for autism susceptibility. In the current study X-chromosomal gene, MAOA responsible for degradation of serotonin is investigated for possible association with ASD using population-based approach. Study covers analysis of 8 markers in 421 subjects including cases and ethnically-matched controls from West Bengal. MAOA marker, rs6323 and various haplotypes formed between the markers show significant association with the disorder. Stratification on the basis of sex reveals significant genetic effect of rs6323 with low activity T allele posing higher risk in males, but not in females. Haplotypic association results also show differential effect both in males and females. Contrasting linkage disequilibrium pattern between pair of markers involving rs6323 in male cases and controls further supports the sex-bias in genetic association. Bioinformatic analysis shows presence of Y-encoded SRY transcription factor binding sites in the neighborhood of rs1137070. C allele of rs1137070 causes deletion of GATA-2 binding site and GATA-2 is known to interact with SRY. This is the first study highlighting male-specific effect of rs6323 marker and its haplotypes in ASD etiology and it suggests sexual dimorphic effect of MAOA in this disorder. Overall results of this study identify MAOA as a possible ASD susceptibility locus and the differential genetic effect in males and females might contribute to the sex ratio differences and molecular pathology of the disorder.

We completed a genome-wide association study in 126,936 European American and 17,029 African American subjects in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program for a quantitative phenotype based on maximum habitual alcohol consumption. ADH1B, on chromosome 4, was the lead locus for both populations: for the European American sample, rs1229984 (p= 4.9 10-47); for African American, rs2066702 (p= 2.3 10-12). In the European American sample, we identified three additional genome-wide-significant maximum habitual alcohol consumption loci: on chromosome 17, rs77804065 (p= 1.5 10-12), at CRHR1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1); the protein product of this gene is involved in stress and immune responses; and on chromosomes 8 and 10. European American and African American samples were then meta-analyzed; the associated region at CRHR1 increased in significance to 1.02 10-13, and we identified two additional genome-wide significant loci, FGF14 (p= 9.86 10-9) (chromosome 13) and a locus on chromosome 11. Besides ADH1B, none of the five loci have prior genome-wide significant support. Post-genome-wide association study analysis identified genetic correlation to other alcohol-related traits, smoking-related traits, and many others. Replications were observed in UK Biobank data. Genetic correlation between maximum habitual alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence was 0.87 (p= 4.78 10-9).

Children were assessed with a multi-informant, best-estimate diagnostic procedure and laboratory measures of working memory, response inhibition, executive functioning, arousal/attention, temporal information processing, and processing speed. Latent variables were created for the candidate cognitive measures and for parent- and teacher-rated ADHD dimensions. Polygenic risk scores (PGS) were computed using a discovery sample of 20,183 individuals with ADHD and 35,191 controls from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium. Cognitive measures that survived multiple testing correction for association with the PGS were evaluated for mediation with ADHD using structural equation models. Results were essentially identical in the homogeneous European ancestry subgroup (n= 514) and in the full sample (N= 656). For the European population, the PGS was associated with ADHD diagnosis (Nagelkerke R2= 0.045; ?= 0.233, SE= 0.053, p=.000011) and multi-indicator dimensional ADHD latent variables by parent report (?= 0.185, SE= 0.043) and teacher report (?= 0.165, SE= 0.042).

In this paper, we studied candidate serotonergic genes and homogenous phenotypic subgroups as presented through obsessive-compulsive (OC) trait dimensions in a general population of children and adolescents. We hypothesized that different serotonergic gene variants are associated with different OC trait dimensions and, furthermore, that they vary by sex. Obsessive-compulsive trait dimensions (Cleaning/Contamination, Counting/Checking, Symmetry/Ordering, Superstition, Rumination, and Hoarding) were examined in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community using the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (TOCS). We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (directly genotyping the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in SLC6A4 for 2018 individuals and using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data for genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4711 individuals). We assessed the association between variants across these genes and each of the OC trait dimensions, within males and females separately. We analyzed OC traits as both (a) dichotomized based on a threshold value and (b) quantitative scores. The [LG + S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding in males (p-value of 0.003 and 0.004 for categorical and continuous analyses, respectively). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. Using SNP array data, there were significant findings for rumination in males for HTR2A SNPs (p-value of 1.04e-6 to 5.20e-6). This represents the first genetic association study of OC trait dimensions in a community-based pediatric sample. Our strongest results indicate that hoarding and rumination may be distinct in their association with serotonin gene variants and that serotonin gene variation may be specific to sex.

The TSMR supported a causal effect of insomnia, daytime napping, and short sleep duration on ADHD, and of ADHD on long sleep duration and chronotype.

However, most conferr a risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). The objective of this investigation was to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AIWG, followed by comprehensive, post-GWAS approaches. We investigated n?=?201 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients of European and African American ancestry who were treated primarily with clozapine or olanzapine. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis for AIWG, defined primarily as a percentage of weight change from baseline. When examining Europeans (n?=?147), we noticed an association between rs62097526 (??=?0.39, p?=?3.59??10-6, CADD?=?2.213) variant, located downstream of the CIDEA gene, which is considered a risk factor for AIWG. In the entire sample, we observed a significant association between rs1525085 (??=?0.411, p?=?3.15??10-9) variant of the DGKB gene and AIWG. The association was nominally significant in Europeans (??=?0.271, p?=?0.002) and African Americans (??=?0.579, p?=?5.73??10-5) with the same risk allele. Our top genes (p?<?5??10-5) were enriched in the GWAS catalog for the risk of obesity and interacted with the known risk factors for obesity (G6PD) and diabetes (IRS1). In addition, these genes are targeted by miRNAs related to schizophrenia (mir-34a) and obesity (mir-19b). However, our polygenic risk score analyses did not provide support for major genetic overlap between obesity and the risk of AIWG. In summary, we propose that the CIDEA and DGKB genes are risk factors for AIWG in transethnic populations.

Quantitative genome-wide association study of six phenotypic subdomains identifies novel genome-wide significant variants in autism spectrum disorder,"Yousaf, Afsheen; Waltes, Regina; Haslinger, Denise; Klauck, Sabine M; Duketis, Eftichia; Sachse, Michael; Voran, Anette; Biscaldi, Monica; Schulte-Rther, Martin; Cichon, Sven; Nthen, Markus; Ackermann, Jrg; Koch, Ina; Freitag, Christine M; Chiocchetti, Andreas G","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heritable and are characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Twin studies on phenotypic subdomains suggest a differing underlying genetic etiology. Studying genetic variation explaining phenotypic variance will help to identify specific underlying pathomechanisms. We investigated the effect of common variation on ASD subdomains in two cohorts including >2500 individuals. Based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), we identified and confirmed six subdomains with a SNP-based genetic heritability h2SNP?=?0.2-0.4. The subdomains nonverbal communication (NVC), social interaction (SI), and peer interaction (PI) shared genetic risk factors, while the subdomains of repetitive sensory-motor behavior (RB) and restricted interests (RI) were genetically independent of each other. The polygenic risk score (PRS) for ASD as categorical diagnosis explained 2.3-3.3% of the variance of SI, joint attention (JA), and PI, 4.5% for RI, 1.2% of RB, but only 0.7% of NVC. We report eight genome-wide significant hits-partially replicating previous findings-and 292 known and novel candidate genes. The underlying biological mechanisms were related to neuronal transmission and development. At the SNP and gene level, all subdomains showed overlap, with the exception of RB. However, no overlap was observed at the functional level. In summary, the ADI-R algorithm-derived subdomains related to social communication show a shared genetic etiology in contrast to restricted and repetitive behaviors. The ASD-specific PRS overlapped only partially, suggesting an additional role of specific common variation in shaping the phenotypic expression of ASD subdomains.",2020,,Translational psychiatry,10,1,215,,10.1038/s41398-020-00906-2,,#4545,Yousaf 2020,"",""

Effects of ethnicity on D2R were not driven by variation in dopaminergic candidate genes. Instead, candidate gene associations with striatal D2R were diminished when correcting for ancestry.

Genetic and shared environmental factors explain the association between adolescent polysubstance use and high school noncompletion,"Davis, Christal N; Gizer, Ian R; Agrawal, Arpana; Statham, Dixie J; Heath, Andrew C; Martin, Nicholas G; Slutske, Wendy S","Examine the nature of the relationship between adolescent polysubstance use and high school noncompletion. Among a sample of 9,579 adult Australian twins (58.63% female, Mage = 30.59), we examined the association between the number of substances used in adolescence and high school noncompletion within a discordant twin design and bivariate twin analysis. In individual-level models controlling for parental education, conduct disorder symptoms, childhood major depression, sex, zygosity, and cohort, each additional substance used in adolescence was associated with a 30% increase in the odds of high school noncompletion (OR = 1.30 [1.18, 1.42]). Discordant twin models found that the potentially causal effect of adolescent use on high school noncompletion was nonsignificant (OR = 1.19 [0.96, 1.47]). Follow-up bivariate twin models suggested genetic (35.4%, 95% CI [24.5%, 48.7%]) and shared environmental influences (27.8%, 95% CI [12.7%, 35.1%]) each contributed to the covariation in adolescent polysubstance use and early school dropout. The association between polysubstance use and early school dropout was largely accounted for by genetic and shared environmental factors, with nonsignificant evidence for a potentially causal association. Future research should examine whether underlying shared risk factors reflect a general propensity for addiction, a broader externalizing liability, or a combination of the two. More evidence using finer measurement of substance use is needed to rule out a causal association between adolescent polysubstance use and high school noncompletion.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of clozapine in an ancestrally diverse sample: a longitudinal analysis and genome-wide association study using UK clinical monitoring data,"Pardias, Antonio F; Kappel, Djenifer B; Roberts, Milly; Tipple, Francesca; Shitomi-Jones, Lisa M; King, Adrian; Jansen, John; Helthuis, Marinka; Owen, Michael J; O'Donovan, Michael C; Walters, James T R","The antipsychotic, clozapine, is the only licensed drug against the treatment-resistant symptoms that affect 20-30% of people with schizophrenia. Clozapine is markedly underprescribed, partly because of concerns about its narrow therapeutic range and adverse drug reaction profile. Both concerns are linked to drug metabolism, which varies across populations globally and is partly genetically determined. Our study aimed to use a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) design to investigate variations in clozapine metabolism within and between genetically inferred ancestral backgrounds, to discover genomic associations to clozapine plasma concentrations, and to assess the effects of pharmacogenomic predictors across different ancestries. In this GWAS, we analysed data from the UK Zaponex Treatment Access System clozapine monitoring service as part of the CLOZUK study. We included all available individuals with clozapine pharmacokinetic assays requested by their clinicians. We excluded people younger than 18 years, or whose records contained clerical errors, or with blood drawn 6-24 h after dose, a clozapine or norclozapine concentration less than 50 ng/mL, a clozapine concentration of more than 2000 ng/mL, a clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio outside of the 05-30 interval, or a clozapine dose of more than 900 mg/day. Using genomic information, we identified five biogeographical ancestries: European, sub-Saharan African, north African, southwest Asian, and east Asian. We did pharmacokinetic modelling, a GWAS, and a polygenic risk score association analysis using longitudinal regression analysis with three primary outcome variables: two metabolite plasma concentrations (clozapine and norclozapine) and the clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio. 19?096 pharmacokinetic assays were available for 4760 individuals in the CLOZUK study. After data quality control, 4495 individuals (3268 [727%] male and 1227 [273%] female; mean age 4219 years [range 18-85]) linked to 16?068 assays were included in this study. We found a faster average clozapine metabolism in people of sub-Saharan African ancestry than in those of European ancestry. By contrast, individuals with east Asian or southwest Asian ancestry were more likely to be slow clozapine metabolisers than those with European ancestry. Eight pharmacogenomic loci were identified in the GWAS, seven with significant effects in non-European groups. Polygenic scores generated from these loci were associated with clozapine outcome variables in the whole sample and within individual ancestries; the maximum variance explained was 726% for the metabolic ratio. Longitudinal cross-ancestry GWAS can discover pharmacogenomic markers of clozapine metabolism that, individually or as polygenic scores, have consistent effects across ancestries. Our findings suggest that ancestral differences in clozapine metabolism could be considered for optimising clozapine prescription protocols for diverse populations.

Gene-finding studies are scarce. In this study, the influence of genome-wide measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was investigated in 3 cohorts (total N = 4,596 children) in which INT was assessed with the same instrument, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Method: First, genome-wide association (GWA) results were used for density estimation and genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to calculate the variance explained by all SNPs. Next, a fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis of the 3 GWA analyses was carried out. Finally, the overlap in results with prior GWA studies of childhood and adulthood psychiatric disorders and treatment responses was tested by examining whether SNPs associated with these traits jointly showed a significant signal for INT. Results: Genome-wide SNPs explained 13% to 43% of the total variance. This indicates that the genetic architecture of INT mirrors the polygenic model underlying adult psychiatric traits. The meta-analysis did not yield a genome-wide significant signal but was suggestive for the PCSK2 gene located on chromosome 20p12.1. SNPs associated with other psychiatric disorders appeared to be enriched for signals with INT (? = 1.26, p <.03). Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that INT is influenced by many common genetic variants, each with a very small effect, and that, even as early as age 3, genetic variants influencing INT overlap with variants that play a role in childhood and adulthood psychiatric disorders.",2014,,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,53,6,667-676,,,,#4568,Benke 2014,"",""

Here we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of childhood AGG, in which all phenotype measures across childhood ages from multiple assessors were included. We analyzed phenotype assessments for a total of 328 935 observations from 87 485 children aged between 1.5 and 18 years, while accounting for sample overlap. We also meta-analyzed within subsets of the data, i.e., within rater, instrument and age. SNP-heritability for the overall meta-analysis (AGG overall) was 3.31% (SE?=?0.0038). We found no genome-wide significant SNPs for AGG overall. The gene-based analysis returned three significant genes: ST3GAL3 (P?=?1.6E-06), PCDH7 (P?=?2.0E-06), and IPO13 (P?=?2.5E-06). All three genes have previously been associated with educational traits. Polygenic scores based on our GWAMA significantly predicted aggression in a holdout sample of children (variance explained = 0.44%) and in retrospectively assessed childhood aggression (variance explained = 0.20%). Genetic correlations (r g) among rater-specific assessment of AGG ranged from r g ?=?0.46 between self- and teacher-assessment to r g ?=?0.81 between mother- and teacher-assessment. We obtained moderate-to-strong r gs with selected phenotypes from multiple domains, but hardly with any of the classical biomarkers thought to be associated with AGG. Significant genetic correlations were observed with most psychiatric and psychological traits (range [Formula: see text]: 0.19-1.00), except for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Aggression had a negative genetic correlation (r g ?=?~-0.5) with cognitive traits and age at first birth. Aggression was strongly genetically correlated with smoking phenotypes (range [Formula: see text]: 0.46-0.60).

Racial Discrimination and Alcohol Problems: Examining Interactions with Genetic Risk and Impulsivity among African American Young Adults,"Su, Jinni; Trevino, Angel D; Kuo, Sally I-Chun; Aliev, Fazil; Williams, Chelsea Derlan; Guy, Mignonne C; Spit for Science Working Group; Dick, Danielle M","Experiences of racial discrimination have been shown to increase risk for alcohol problems. Some individuals may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of racial discrimination. However, little research has examined interaction effects between racial discrimination and individual characteristics, such as genetic predispositions and personality, in relation to alcohol outcomes. This study examined whether genetic risk and dimensions of impulsivity moderate the association between racial discrimination and alcohol problems among African American young adults (n?=?383, Mage?=?20.65, SD?=?2.28; 81% female). Participants completed online surveys and provided a saliva sample for genotyping. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that both blatant and subtle forms of racial discrimination (i.e., experience of racist events and racial microaggressions) were associated with more alcohol problems. Racial microaggressions interacted with dimensions of impulsivity in relation to alcohol problems, such that racial microaggressions were associated with more alcohol problems when negative urgency was high or when sensation seeking was low. There was no significant interaction between alcohol use disorder genome-wide polygenic score and experience of racist events or racial microaggression in relation to alcohol problems, which may partly reflect low power due in part to limited representation of African-Americans in genetic research. The findings highlight the need to increase the representation of African Americans in genetically-informed research in order to better characterize genetic risk and understand gene-environment interaction in this understudied population, as well as the importance of examining impulsivity as a multidimensional construct that interacts with racial discrimination in relation to alcohol outcomes.  2022.

While for some disorders the linguistic deficit is the primary impairment (e.g., specific language impairment, SLI), for others it may accompany broader behavioral problems (e.g., autism). The precise nature of this phenotypic overlap has been the subject of debate. Moreover, several studies have found genetic overlaps across neurodevelopmental disorders. This raises the question of whether these genetic overlaps may correlate with phenotypic overlaps and, if so, in what manner. Here, we apply a genome-wide approach to the study of the linguistic deficit in SLI, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using a discovery genome-wide association study of SLI, we generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in an independent sample which includes children with language impairment, SLI, ASD or ADHD and age-matched controls and perform regression analyses across groups. The SLI-trained PRS significantly predicted risk in the SLI case-control group (adjusted R2 = 6.24%; P = 0.024) but not in the ASD or ADHD case-control groups (adjusted R2 = 0.0004%, 0.01%; P = 0.984, 0.889, respectively) nor for height, used as a negative control (R2 = 0.2%; P = 0.452). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the normalized PRS between children with SLI and children with ASD (common language effect size = 0.66; P = 0.044). Our study suggests no additive common-variant genetic overlap between SLI and ASD and ADHD. This is discussed in the context of phenotypic studies of SLI and related disorders.

LAY SUMMARY: Language deficits are characteristic of specific language impairment (SLI), but may also be found in other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Many studies examined the overlaps and differences across the language deficits in these disorders, but few studies have examined the genetic aspect thereof. In this study, we use a genome-wide approach to evaluate whether common genetic variants increasing risk of SLI may also be associated with ASD and ADHD in the same manner. Our results suggest that this is not the case, and we discuss this finding in the context of theories concerning the etiologies of these disorders.  2019 The Authors.

A genome wide association study suggests the association of muskelin with early onset bipolar disorder: Implications for a GABAergic epileptogenic neurogenesis model,"Nassan, Malik; Li, Qingqin; Croarkin, Paul E; Chen, Wenan; Colby, Colin L; Veldic, Marin; Mcelroy, Susan L; Jenkins, Gregory D; Ryu, Euijung; Cunningham, Julie M; Leboyer, Marion; Frye, Mark A; Biernacka, Joanna M","Although multiple genes have been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD), they explain only a small proportion of its heritability. Identifying additional BD risk variants may be impaired by phenotypic heterogeneity, which is usually not taken into account in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). BD with early age at onset is a more homogeneous familial form of the disorder associated with greater symptom severity. We conducted a GWAS of early-onset BD (onset of mania/hypomania ?19 years old) in a discovery sample of 419 cases and 1034 controls and a replication sample of 181 cases and 777 controls. These two samples were meta-analyzed, followed by replication of one signal in a third independent sample of 141 cases and 746 controls. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were genome-wide significant in the discovery sample. Of the top 15 SNPs in the discovery analysis, rs114034759 in the muskelin (MKLN1) gene was nominally significant in the replication analysis, and was among the top associations in the meta-analysis (p=2.63E-06, OR=1.9). In the third sample, this SNP was again associated with early-onset BD (p=0.036, OR=1.6). Gene expression analysis showed that the rs114034759 risk allele is associated with decreased hippocampal MKLN1 expression. The sample sizes of the early-onset BD subgroups were relatively small. Our results suggest MKLN1 is associated with early-onset BD. MKLN1 regulates cellular trafficking of GABA-A receptors, which is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and is implicated in the mechanism of action of a group of antiepileptic mood stabilizers. These results therefore indicate that GABAergic neurotransmission may be implicated in early-onset BD. We propose that an increase in GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus in BD patients due to lower MKLN1 expression might increase the excitability during the GABA-excited early phase of young neurons, leading to an increased risk of developing a manic/hypomanic episode. Further studies are needed to test this model. Copyright  2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recognizing the major impact of these psychiatric disorders on the psychosocial function of more than 200 000 US Veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently completed genotyping of more than 8000 veterans with SCZ and BIP in the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #572. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in CSP #572 and benchmarked the predictive value of polygenic risk scores (PRS) constructed from published findings. We combined our results with available summary statistics from several recent GWAS, realizing the largest and most diverse studies of these disorders to date. Our primary GWAS uncovered new associations between CHD7 variants and SCZ, and novel BIP associations with variants in Sortilin Related VPS10 Domain Containing Receptor 3 (SORCS3) and downstream of PCDH11X. Combining our results with published summary statistics for SCZ yielded 39 novel susceptibility loci including CRHR1, and we identified 10 additional findings for BIP (28 326 cases and 90 570 controls). PRS trained on published GWAS were significantly associated with case-control status among European American (P < 10-30) and African American (P <.0005) participants in CSP #572.

This study investigated WMHs in a young population at high genetic risk for bipolar disorder (HR). MRI scans were conducted at baseline in HR individuals (n?=?131), patients with BD (n?=?47) and controls (CON) (n?=?108). Most of the HR (n?=?77) and CON (n?=?74) group completed scans after two years. Scans were examined for the presence of WMHs. There were significantly more periventricular WMHs in the BD compared to the CON group at baseline (p?=?.04). Although the prevalence of periventricular WMHs was intermediate in the HR group, there were no significant differences between the HR and CON or BD participants. Deep WMHs did not differ significantly between the groups. Over time, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of periventricular WMHs in both the HR and CON groups (p?=?.02). The use of a visual rating scale to examine WMHs is subjective. As the gradings were collapsed into 'present' or 'absent', we could not ascertain whether the severity of hyperintensities worsened over time. Periventricular WMHs are more prevalent in young individuals with BD than controls.

Despite differing on diagnostic definitions based on clinical presentation, ADs likely represent various expressions of an underlying common diathesis of abnormal regulation of basic threat-response systems. We conducted genome-wide association analyses in nine samples of European ancestry from seven large, independent studies. To identify genetic variants contributing to genetic susceptibility shared across interview-generated DSM-based ADs, we applied two phenotypic approaches: (1) comparisons between categorical AD cases and supernormal controls, and (2) quantitative phenotypic factor scores (FS) derived from a multivariate analysis combining information across the clinical phenotypes. We used logistic and linear regression, respectively, to analyze the association between these phenotypes and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Meta-analysis for each phenotype combined results across the nine samples for over 18?000 unrelated individuals. Each meta-analysis identified a different genome-wide significant region, with the following markers showing the strongest association: for case-control contrasts, rs1709393 located in an uncharacterized non-coding RNA locus on chromosomal band 3q12.3 (P=1.65  10(-8)); for FS, rs1067327 within CAMKMT encoding the calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase on chromosomal band 2p21 (P=2.86  10(-9)).

The association between screen time and genetic risks for neurodevelopmental disorders in children,"Takahashi, Nagahide; Tsuchiya, Kenji J; Okumura, Akemi; Harada, Taeko; Iwabuchi, Toshiki; Rahman, Md Shafiur; Kuwabara, Hitoshi; Nomura, Yoko; Nishimura, Tomoko","Whether longer screen time in infancy increases risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD has long been debated, but no causal relationship between the two remains has been established. Using ongoing longitudinal cohort data, we found that in children 24 to 40 months of age, the genetic risk of ASD was associated with longer screen time and that of ADHD with an increase in screen time over time.

"Using structural MRI to identify individuals at genetic risk for bipolar disorders: a 2-cohort, machine learning study","Hajek, Tomas; Cooke, Christopher; Kopecek, Miloslav; Novak, Tomas; Hoschl, Cyril; Alda, Martin","Brain imaging is of limited diagnostic use in psychiatry owing to clinical heterogeneity and low sensitivity/specificity of between-group neuroimaging differences. Machine learning (ML) may better translate neuroimaging to the level of individual participants. Studying unaffected offspring of parents with bipolar disorders (BD) decreases clinical heterogeneity and thus increases sensitivity for detection of biomarkers. The present study used ML to identify individuals at genetic high risk (HR) for BD based on brain structure. We studied unaffected and affected relatives of BD probands recruited from 2 sites (Halifax, Canada, and Prague, Czech Republic). Each participant was individually matched by age and sex to controls without personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. We applied support vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian process classifiers (GPC) to structural MRI. We included 45 unaffected and 36 affected relatives of BD probands matched by age and sex on an individual basis to healthy controls. The SVM of white matter distinguished unaffected HR from control participants (accuracy = 68.9%, p = 0.001), with similar accuracy for the GPC (65.6%, p = 0.002) or when analyzing data from each site separately. Differentiation of the more clinically heterogeneous affected familiar group from healthy controls was less accurate (accuracy = 59.7%, p = 0.05). Machine learning applied to grey matter did not distinguish either the unaffected HR or affected familial groups from controls. The regions that most contributed to between-group discrimination included white matter of the inferior/middle frontal gyrus, inferior/middle temporal gyrus and precuneus. Although we recruited 126 participants, ML benefits from even larger samples.

Association of polygenic risk for bipolar disorder with grey matter structure and white matter integrity in youth,"Jiang, Xinyue; Zai, Clement C; Kennedy, Kody G; Zou, Yi; Nikolova, Yuliya S; Felsky, Daniel; Young, L Trevor; Macintosh, Bradley J; Goldstein, Benjamin I","There is a gap in knowledge regarding the polygenic underpinnings of brain anomalies observed in youth bipolar disorder (BD). This study examined the association of a polygenic risk score for BD (BD-PRS) with grey matter structure and white matter integrity in youth with and without BD. 113 participants were included in the analyses, including 78 participants with both T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI images, 32 participants with T1-weighted images only, and 3 participants with diffusion-weighted images only. BD-PRS was calculated using PRS-CS-auto and was based on independent adult genome-wide summary statistics. Vertex- and voxel-wise analyses examined the associations of BD-PRS with grey matter metrics (cortical volume [CV], cortical surface area [CSA], cortical thickness [CTh]) and fractional anisotropy [FA] in the combined sample, and separately in BD and HC. In the combined sample of participants with T1-weighted images (n?=?110, 66 BD, 44 HC), higher BD-PRS was associated with smaller grey matter metrics in frontal and temporal regions. In within-group analyses, higher BD-PRS was associated with lower CTh of frontal, temporal, and fusiform gyrus in BD, and with lower CV and CSA of superior frontal gyrus in HC. In the combined sample of participants with diffusion-weighted images (n?=?81, 49 BD, 32 HC), higher BD-PRS was associated with lower FA in widespread white matter regions. In summary, BD-PRS calculated based on adult genetic data was negatively associated with grey matter structure and FA in youth in regions implicated in BD, which may suggest neuroimaging markers of vulnerability to BD. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether BD-PRS predicts neurodevelopmental changes in BD vs. HC and its interaction with course of illness and long-term medication use.  2023.

Genetic research in autism spectrum disorders is limited by the fact that these disorders are largely heterogeneous so that patients are variable in their clinical presentations. To address this limitation, we investigated the genetics of individual dimensions of the autism spectrum disorder phenotypes, or autistic-like traits. These autistic-like traits are continuous variations in autistic behaviours that occur in the general population. Therefore, we meta-analysed data from four different population cohorts in which autistic-like traits were measured. We performed a set of genetic analyses to identify common variants for autistic-like traits, understand how these variants related to autism spectrum disorders, and how they contribute to neurobiological processes. Our results showed genetic associations with specific autistic-like traits and a link to the immune system. We offer an example of the potential to use a dimensional approach when dealing with heterogeneous, complex disorder like autism spectrum disorder.

We found associations between SZ-PRS and (1) both negative (B?=?0.18; 95%CI 0.03-0.33) and positive (B?=?0.19; 95%CI 0.03-0.35) symptom dimensions in 617 FEP patients, regardless of their categorical diagnosis; and (2) all the psychotic experience dimensions in 979 controls. We did not observe associations between SZ-PRS and the general and affective dimensions in FEP. Daily and current cannabis use were associated with the positive dimensions in FEP (B?=?0.31; 95%CI 0.11-0.52) and in controls (B?=?0.26; 95%CI 0.06-0.46), over and above SZ-PRS. We provide evidence that genetic liability to schizophrenia and cannabis use map onto transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, supporting the validity and utility of the dimensional representation of psychosis. In our sample, genetic liability to schizophrenia correlated with more severe psychosis presentation, and cannabis use conferred risk to positive symptomatology beyond the genetic risk. Our findings support the hypothesis that psychotic experiences in the general population have similar genetic substrates as clinical disorders.  2021.

Converging evidence suggests a contribution of the polygenic risk for smoking to the use of tobacco and other substances. Yet, the underlying brain mechanisms between the genetic risk and tobacco smoking remain poorly understood. Methods: Genomic, neuroimaging, and self-report data were acquired from a large cohort of adolescents from the IMAGEN study (a European multicenter study). Polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for smoking were calculated based on a genome-wide association study meta-analysis conducted by the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium. We examined the interrelationships among the genetic risk for smoking initiation, brain structure, and the number of occasions of tobacco use. Results: A higher smoking PGRS was significantly associated with both an increased number of occasions of tobacco use and smaller cortical volume of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Furthermore, reduced cortical volume within this cluster correlated with greater tobacco use. A subsequent path analysis suggested that the cortical volume within this cluster partially mediated the association between the genetic risk for smoking and the number of occasions of tobacco use. Conclusions: Our data provide the first evidence for the involvement of the OFC in the relationship between smoking PGRS and tobacco use. Future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying tobacco smoking should consider the mediation effect of the related neural structure.",2022,,Psychological Medicine,52,,1175-1182,,10.1017/S0033291720002962,,#4648,Li 2022,"",""
"Serotonin system genes and hoarding with and without other obsessive-compulsive traits in a population-based, pediatric sample: A genetic association study","Sinopoli, Vanessa M; Erdman, Lauren; Burton, Christie L; Park, Laura S; Dupuis, Annie; Shan, Janet; Goodale, Tara; Shaheen, S-M; Crosbie, Jennifer; Schachar, Russell J; Arnold, Paul D","Hoarding, originally only considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is now categorized as a separate disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). We studied candidate serotonergic genes and the distinctness of hoarding in children and adolescents and hypothesized that unique gene variants would be associated with hoarding alone. We examined obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits, including hoarding, in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community. We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (5-HTTLPR polymorphism inSLC6A4 for 2,018 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] across genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4,711 individuals). In a previous study conducted by our group in the same sample, we identified a significant association between 5-HTTLPR and hoarding in males. In this study, we examined hoarding more closely by testing the association between serotonin gene variants and hoarding traits with and without other accompanying OC traits. The [LG +S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding alone in males (p-value of 0.009). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. There were no significant findings after correction for multiple comparisons using SNP array data, but top SNP findings suggested that variation downstream of HTR1B may be implicated in hoarding alone in females. Our results suggest specific serotonin gene variants are associated with hoarding traits alone, differing between sexes. Top findings are in line with our former study, suggesting that individuals with hoarding alone were driving previous results. Our paper supports hoarding disorder's new designation.  2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2020,,Depression and anxiety,37,8,760-770,,10.1002/da.22996,,#4657,Sinopoli 2020,"",""
"Perceptions of genetic risk, testing, and counseling among individuals with eating disorders","Michael, Julianne E; Bulik, Cynthia M; Hart, Sarah J; Doyle, Lauren; Austin, Jehannine","Eating disorders develop as a result of genetic and environmental factors. Given that they are multifactorial conditions with a genetic component, they fall within the scope of practice for genetic counseling, but people with these conditions are rarely referred. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of causes of eating disorders, recurrence risk, and interest in genetic counseling and testing among individuals with eating disorders. An online survey comprising both multiple choice and free form text questions, vignettes about genetic counseling, and the ED100K (validated eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire) was shared via support organizations and prominent bloggers in the eating disorders community to recruit individuals with a personal history of an eating disorder from November 2018 to February 2019. In total, 107 participants completed the survey. They perceived that both experiences and genetics were important factors in the development of their eating disorder. All responding participants overestimated the risk for recurrence of eating disorders in children, often by a large margin, and a notable minority reported that their experience with an eating disorder had a negative influence on their childbearing decisions. After imagined experience of genetic counseling, participants reported significantly decreased feelings of stigma, shame, and guilt. Most participants expressed interest in genetic counseling; fewer were interested in genetic testing. Genetic counseling may benefit individuals with eating disorders by providing accurate recurrence risk information and reducing feelings of guilt, stigma, and shame, which may in turn encourage earlier support seeking and recovery.  2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2020,,The International journal of eating disorders,53,9,1496-1505,,10.1002/eat.23333,,#4663,Michael 2020,"",""

To identify novel BP loci, we carried out genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial BP, taking into account the interaction effects of genetic variants with three psychosocial factors: depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and social support. Analyses were performed using a two-stage design in a sample of up to 128,894 adults from five ancestry groups. In the combined meta-analyses of stages 1 and 2, we identified 59 loci (p value < 5e?8), including nine novel BP loci. The novel associations were observed mostly with pulse pressure, with fewer observed with mean arterial pressure. Five novel loci were identified in African ancestry, and all but one showed patterns of interaction with at least one psychosocial factor. Functional annotation of the novel loci supports a major role for genes implicated in the immune response (PLCL2), synaptic function and neurotransmission (LIN7A and PFIA2), as well as genes previously implicated in neuropsychiatric or stress-related disorders (FSTL5 and CHODL).

The molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response heterogeneity are not well understood, and personalized treatment in BD remains elusive. Genetic analyses of the lithium treatment response phenotype may generate novel molecular insights into lithium's therapeutic mechanisms and lead to testable hypotheses to improve BD management and outcomes. We used fixed effect meta-analysis techniques to develop meta-analytic polygenic risk scores (MET-PRS) from combinations of highly correlated psychiatric traits, namely schizophrenia (SCZ), major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD). We compared the effects of cross-disorder MET-PRS and single genetic trait PRS on lithium response. For the PRS analyses, we included clinical data on lithium treatment response and genetic information for n?=?2283 BD cases from the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen; www.ConLiGen.org ). Higher SCZ and MD PRSs were associated with poorer lithium treatment response whereas BD-PRS had no association with treatment outcome. The combined MET2-PRS comprising of SCZ and MD variants (MET2-PRS) and a model using SCZ and MD-PRS sequentially improved response prediction, compared to single-disorder PRS or to a combined score using all three traits (MET3-PRS). Patients in the highest decile for MET2-PRS loading had 2.5 times higher odds of being classified as poor responders than patients with the lowest decile MET2-PRS scores.

Since evidence shows a strong clinical and genetic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder, we investigated whether a polygenic susceptibility to major depression is associated with response to lithium treatment in patients with BD. Weighted polygenic scores (PGSs) were computed for major depression (MD) at different GWAS p value thresholds using genetic data obtained from 2586 bipolar patients who received lithium treatment and took part in the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen) study. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies in MD (135,458 cases and 344,901 controls) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) were used for PGS weighting. Response to lithium treatment was defined by continuous scores and categorical outcome (responders versus non-responders) using measurements on the Alda scale. Associations between PGSs of MDand lithium treatment response were assessed using a linear and binary logistic regression modeling for the continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. The analysis was performed for the entire cohort, and for European and Asian sub-samples. The PGSs for MD were significantly associated with lithium treatment response in multi-ethnic, European or Asian populations, at various p value thresholds. Bipolar patients with a low polygenic load for MDwere more likely to respond well to lithium, compared to thosepatients with high polygenic load [lowest vs highest PGS quartiles, multi-ethnic sample: OR?=?1.54 (95% CI: 1.18-2.01) and European sample: OR?=?1.75 (95% CI: 1.30-2.36)]. While our analysis in the Asian sample found equivalent effect size in the same direction: OR?=?1.71 (95% CI: 0.61-4.90), this was not statistically significant. Using PGS decile comparison, we found a similar trend of association between a high genetic loading for MD and lower response to lithium. Our findings underscore the genetic contribution to lithium response in BD and support the emerging concept of a lithium-responsive biotype in BD.  2020.

The observed regional distribution and effect size of cortical thickness reductions in obesity revealed considerable similarities with corresponding patterns of lower cortical thickness in previously published studies of neuropsychiatric disorders.

We hypothesized that co-expression pathways of SCZ risk genes are associated with system-level brain function and clinical phenotypes of SCZ. We examined genetic variants related to the dopamine D2 receptor gene DRD2 co-expression pathway and associated them with working memory (WM) behavior, the related brain activity and treatment response. Using two independent post-mortem prefrontal messenger RNA (mRNA) data sets (total N=249), we identified a DRD2 co-expression pathway enriched for SCZ risk genes. Next, we identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with co-expression of this pathway. These SNPs were associated with regulatory genetic loci in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P<0.05). We summarized their compound effect on co-expression into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI), which predicted DRD2 pathway co-expression in both mRNA data sets (all P<0.05). We associated the PCI with brain activity during WM performance in two independent samples of healthy individuals (total N=368) and 29 patients with SCZ who performed the n-back task. Greater predicted DRD2 pathway prefrontal co-expression was associated with greater prefrontal activity and longer WM reaction times (all corrected P<0.05), thus indicating inefficient WM processing. Blind prediction of treatment response to antipsychotics in two independent samples of patients with SCZ suggested better clinical course of patientswith greater PCI (total N=87; P<0.05).

Does epilepsy in multiplex autism pedigrees define a different subgroup in terms of clinical characteristics and genetic risk?,"Amiet, Claire; Gourfinkel-An, Isabelle; Laurent, Claudine; Bodeau, Nicolas; Gnin, Brengre; Leguern, Eric; Tordjman, Sylvie; Cohen, David","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy frequently occur together. Prevalence rates are variable, and have been attributed to age, gender, comorbidity, subtype of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and risk factors. Recent studies have suggested disparate clinical and genetic settings depending on simplex or multiplex autism. The aim of this study was to assess: 1) the prevalence of epilepsy in multiplex autism and its association with genetic and non-genetic risk factors of major effect, intellectual disability and gender; and 2) whether autism and epilepsy cosegregate within multiplex autism families. We extracted from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) database (n?=?3,818 children from 1,264 families) all families with relevant medical data (n?=?664 children from 290 families). The sample included 478 children with ASD and 186 siblings without ASD. We analyzed the following variables: seizures, genetic and non-genetic risk factors, gender, and cognitive functioning as assessed by Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The prevalence of epilepsy was 12.8% in cases with ASD and 2.2% in siblings without ASD (P <10-5). With each RCPM or VABS measure, the risk of epilepsy in multiplex autism was significantly associated with intellectual disability, but not with gender. Identified risk factors (genetic or non-genetic) of autism tended to be significantly associated with epilepsy (P?=?0.052).

Nevertheless, lithium is not consistently effective, with only 30% of patients showing a favorable response to treatment. To provide personalized treatment options for bipolar patients, it is essential to identify prediction biomarkers such as polygenic scores. In this study, we developed a polygenic score for lithium treatment response (Li+PGS) in patients with BD. To gain further insights into lithium's possible molecular mechanism of action, we performed a genome-wide gene-based analysis. Using polygenic score modeling, via methods incorporating Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors, Li+PGS was developed in the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics cohort (ConLi+Gen: N?=?2367) and replicated in the combined PsyCourse (N?=?89) and BipoLife (N?=?102) studies. The associations of Li+PGS and lithium treatment response - defined in a continuous ALDA scale and a categorical outcome (good response vs. poor response) were tested using regression models, each adjusted for the covariates: age, sex, and the first four genetic principal components. Statistical significance was determined at P?<?0.05. Li+PGS was positively associated with lithium treatment response in the ConLi+Gen cohort, in both the categorical (P?=?9.8??10-12, R2?=?1.9%) and continuous (P?=?6.4??10-9, R2?=?2.6%) outcomes.

A systematic review of associations between functional MRI activity and polygenic risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,"Dezhina, Zalina; Ranlund, Siri; Kyriakopoulos, Marinos; Williams, Steve C R; Dima, Danai","Genetic factors account for up to 80% of the liability for schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified several genes associated with increased risk for both disorders. This has allowed researchers to model the aggregate effect of genes associated with disease status and create a polygenic risk score (PGRS) for each individual. The interest in imaging genetics using PGRS has grown in recent years, with several studies now published. We have conducted a systematic review to examine the effects of PGRS of SCZ, BD and cross psychiatric disorders on brain function and connectivity using fMRI data. Results indicate that the effect of genetic load for SCZ and BD on brain function affects task-related recruitment, with frontal areas having a more prominent role, independent of task. Additionally, the results suggest that the polygenic architecture of psychotic disorders is not regionally confined but impacts on the task-dependent recruitment of multiple brain regions. Future imaging genetics studies with large samples, especially population studies, would be uniquely informative in mapping the spatial distribution of the genetic risk to psychiatric disorders on brain processes during various cognitive tasks and may lead to the discovery of biological pathways that could be crucial in mediating the link between genetic factors and alterations in brain networks.",2019,,Brain imaging and behavior,13,3,862-877,,10.1007/s11682-018-9879-z,,#4712,Dezhina 2019,"","Review study (e.g. systematic review, meta-analysis, etc)"

Polygenic Scores for Neuropsychiatric Traits and White Matter Microstructure in the Pediatric Population,"Jansen, Philip R; Muetzel, Ryan L; Polderman, Tinca J C; Jaddoe, Vincent W; Verhulst, Frank C; Van Der Lugt, Aad; Tiemeier, Henning; Posthuma, Danielle; White, Tonya","Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants that predispose to neuropsychiatric traits. Identification of mechanisms in the brain that underlie these associations is essential for understanding manifestations of genetic predisposition within the general population. Here, we investigated the association between polygenic scores (PGSs) for seven neuropsychiatric traits and white matter microstructure of the brain on diffusion tensor imaging in the pediatric population. Participants from the Generation R Study who had genotype and diffusion tensor imaging data available (n= 1138, mean age= 10.2 years, range= 8.7-12.0) were included. PGSs were calculated for five psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, autism, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia) and two cognitive traits (intelligence and educational attainment) and were tested for associations with global and tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity. Significant positive associations with global FA were observed for the PGSs of intelligence (?=.109, SE=.029, p <.001, ?R2=.012) and educational attainment (?=.118, SE=.029, p <.001, ?R2=.014). No significant associations were observed with FA for the PGSs of psychiatric disorders. Tract-specific analysis showed that the PGSs for intelligence and educational attainment were associated with FA of several association and projection fibers of the brain. Our results show that genetic predisposition for cognition-related traits, but not for psychiatric disorders, is associated with microstructural diffusion measures of white matter tracts at an early age. These results suggest a shared genetic etiology among structural connectivity, intelligence, and educational achievement. Copyright  2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The cumulative effects of the associated variants can be summarised as a polygenic risk score (PRS). Using data from the EUropean Network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) first episode case-control study, we aimed to test whether PRSs for three major psychiatric disorders (SZ, BD, D) and for intelligent quotient (IQ) as a neurodevelopmental proxy, can discriminate affective psychosis (AP) from schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD). Participants (842 cases, 1284 controls) from 16 European EU-GEI sites were successfully genotyped following standard quality control procedures. The sample was stratified based on genomic ancestry and analyses were done only on the subsample representing the European population (573 cases, 1005 controls). Using PRS for SZ, BD, D, and IQ built from the latest available summary statistics, we performed simple or multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for 10 principal components for the different clinical comparisons. In case-control comparisons PRS-SZ, PRS-BD and PRS-D distributed differentially across psychotic subcategories.

For both symptom domains, we identified associations with several polygenic indices (PGIs) that generally remained stable across development. For externalising symptoms, many of these associations reflected direct genetic effects. Concordant results were observed in the Born in Bradford cohort. A higher exome-wide burden of deleterious rare variants was associated with increased externalising (p-adj<0.03) and internalising symptoms (p-adj<0.01); trio models indicated direct genetic effects on externalising in MCS (p<0.05; p-adj>0.05) and on internalising symptoms in ALSPAC (p-adj<0.02). Common and rare genetic variants contributed independently, jointly explaining 2% of the variance in internalising and 5-7% in externalising symptoms.

Brain-PAD was estimated using a publicly available machine learning model previously trained on a combination of region-wise T1-weighted grey-matter measures. We found little evidence for an association between PEs and brain-PAD after adjusting for age and sex (Cohen’s d = -0.21 [95% CI -0.47, 0.05], p = 0.11). While there was some evidence for lower brain-PAD in those with PEs relative to those without PEs after additionally adjusting for parental social class (Cohen’s d = -0.31 [95% CI -0.58, -0.03], p = 0.031) or birth weight (Cohen’s d = -0.29 [95% CI -0.55, -0.03], p = 0.038), adjusting for maternal education or childhood IQ did not alter the primary results. These findings do not support the notion of advanced brain age in older adolescents with PEs.

Furthermore, the prospective accuracy of ruling out depression/dysthymia was superior to the accuracy of ruling it in. This lower positive likelihood ratio might be overcome in future by stepwise approaches that further stratify risk in those initially identified as at increased risk of depression/dysthymia.",2023,,Research Square,,,,PPR761508,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3611793/v1,,#4742,Styss 2023,"",""
"Childhood conduct problems, potential snares in adolescence and problematic substance use in Brazil","Stocker, Fauve; Heron, Jon; Hickman, Matthew; Wehrmeister, Fernando; Gonçalves, Helen; Menezes, Ana Maria; Murray, Joseph; Hammerton, Gemma","<h4>Objective</h4> Examine whether the relationship between childhood conduct problems and substance use in adulthood is explained through potential snares (police arrest, gang membership, school non-completion) in a Brazilian population-based birth cohort. <h4>Method</h4> Data were analyzed from 4,599 young people from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort in Brazil. The exposure was conduct problems at age 11 years. Outcomes included hazardous alcohol consumption and illicit drug use (age 22 years). Mediators included police arrest (by age 18 years), gang membership (ages 18 and 22 years), and school non-completion (by age 22 years). We performed counterfactual mediation using the parametric g-computation formula to estimate the indirect effect via all three mediators simultaneously. <h4>Results</h4> After adjusting for confounders (including comorbidity), conduct problems were weakly associated with police arrest [OR (95% CI)=1.45 (0.97, 2.16)] and school non-completion [OR (95% CI)=1.46 (1.22, 1.74)], but not with gang membership. Police arrest and gang membership were associated with illicit drug use [OR (95% CI)=3.84 (2.46, 5.99); OR (95% CI)=7.78 (4.30, 14.10), respectively] and with hazardous alcohol use [OR (95% CI)=1.60 (1.08, 2.38); OR (95% CI)=1.88 (1.07, 3.30)]. However, there was no association between school non-completion and either outcome after confounder adjustment. There was little evidence for an indirect effect of conduct problems on hazardous alcohol use and illicit drug use via all three mediators after confounder adjustment. <h4>Conclusion</h4> The indirect effects of childhood conduct problems on substance use in early adulthood via police arrest, gang membership, and school non-completion were very small, after accounting for confounders and comorbidity.",2024,,medRxiv,,,,PPR912261,10.1101/2024.09.18.24313884,,#4743,Stocker 2024,"",""
Three components of human brain gene expression reflect normative developmental programmes with specific links to neurodevelopmental disorders,"Dear, Richard; Wagstyl, Konrad; Seidlitz, Jakob; Markello, Ross; Arnatkevičiūtė, Aurina; Anderson, Kevin; Bethlehem, Richard A.I.; =Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium; Raznahan, Armin; Bullmore, Edward; Vértes, Petra","Human brain organisation emerges from the coordinated transcription of thousands of genes, and the first principal component (C1) of spatial whole genome expression was shown to reflect cortical hierarchy. Here, optimised processing of the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed two new components of brain transcription, C2 and C3, which were distinctively enriched for neuronal, metabolic and immune processes, cell-types and cytoarchitecture, and genetic variants associated with intelligence. Using additional datasets (PsychENCODE, Allen Cell Atlas, and BrainSpan), we found that C1-C3 represent generalisable transcriptional programmes that are coordinated within cells, and differentially phased during foetal and postnatal development. Autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia were specifically associated with C1/C2 and C3, respectively, across neuroimaging, gene expression, and genome-wide association studies. Evidence converged especially in support of C3 as a normative transcriptional programme for adolescent brain development, which can lead to atypical supragranular brain connectivity in people at high genetic risk for schizophrenia.",2022,,bioRxiv,,,,PPR555596,10.1101/2022.10.05.510582,,#4744,Dear 2022,"",""
